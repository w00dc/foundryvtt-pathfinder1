The application of the powder depends on the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases\">disease</a> from which it is refined. Someone using powder made from diseases contracted by ingestion must apply it to food (a <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions\">full-round action</a>) for the victim to consume. Those using powder made from diseases contracted by injury must apply the powder to weapons (a <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>, as per the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison\">poison</a> application rules) and deal damage to victims to subject them to the <a class=\"spell\" href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/contagion\">contagion</a>. Diseases contracted by inhalation require the user to disperse the powder by <a class=\"magic-item\" href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/throwing\">throwing</a> it into the air. <a class=\"magic-item\" href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/throwing\">Throwing</a> a handful of plague powder is a splash attack with a range increment of 5 feet. Anyone standing in the square of impact must succeed at a save with a DC equal to that of the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases\">disease</a> from which the powder is made to avoid contracting the illness, while those in adjacent squares must attempt the same save with a +4 bonus. Diseases spread through contact can use any of the three manners of application.</p>\r\n<p>The most common <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases\">disease</a> refined for these powders is filth fever, costing 144 gp, but refined plague powders of other diseases are available, with a price equal to the base save DC of the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases\">disease</a> squared. Making a plague powder always requires access to a sample of the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases\">disease</a> and exposes the creator to the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/diseases\">disease</a> in question each day of crafting. Crafting a dose of plague powder requires a successful DC 25 <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/craft\">Craft</a> (alchemy) check.</p>\r\n",
