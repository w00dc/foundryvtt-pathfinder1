A creature secured in barbed manacles takes 1 point of piercing damage if it takes more than a single <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions\">move action</a> during a round. Rough movement of any kind, such as being struck in combat or falling <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Prone\">prone</a>, likewise causes 1 point of damage. Attempting to break out of barbed manacles with a Strength check deals 1d4 points of piercing damage to the captive regardless of the success of the attempt.</p>\r\n<p>Fetters can also be fitted with barbs, but the wearer can avoid damage by not taking actions that involve moving its legs. Hobgoblins often use such fetters to secure artisans to their worktables. Securing a captive with multiple sets of manacles and/or fetters doesn't cause additional damage.</p>\r\n<p><a name=\"table-tools-kits\"></a></p>\r\n<p>Tool Kits</p>\r\n<p>This section includes several kits of preselected gear for each character class or for specific adventuring purposes (dungeoneering, spelunking, and so on). GMs can use these kits to quickly round out an NPC's gear. Players can use them to equip new PCs in a hurry or as a shorthand for providing gear for cohorts, followers, minions, and hirelings. The listed price for the kit includes a small discount for purchasing these items as a group. Items in a kit that are used up, destroyed, or lost cost the full price to replace.</p>\r\n\n\r\n",
