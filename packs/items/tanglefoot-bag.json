When you throw a tanglefoot bag at a creature (as a ranged <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks\">touch attack</a> with a range increment of 10 feet), the bag comes apart and goo bursts out, entangling the target and then becoming tough and resilient upon exposure to air. An <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Entangled\">entangled</a> creature takes a -2 penalty on <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack rolls</a> and a -4 penalty to <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a> and must make a DC 15 <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex\">Reflex</a> save or be glued to the floor, unable to move. Even on a successful save, it can move only at half speed. Huge or larger creatures are unaffected by a tanglefoot bag. A flying creature is not stuck to the floor, but it must make a DC 15 <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex\">Reflex</a> save or be unable to fly (assuming it uses its wings to fly) and fall to the ground. A tanglefoot bag does not function underwater.</p>\r\n<p>A creature that is glued to the floor (or unable to fly) can break free by making a DC 17 <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-\">Strength</a> check or by dealing 15 points of damage to the goo with a slashing weapon. A creature trying to scrape goo off itself, or another creature assisting, does not need to make an <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack roll</a>; hitting the goo is automatic, after which the creature that hit makes a damage roll to see how much of the goo was scraped off. Once free, the creature can move (including flying) at half speed. If the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Entangled\">entangled</a> creature attempts to cast a spell, it must make <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Concentration\">concentration</a> check with a DC of 15 + the spell's level or be unable to cast the spell. The goo becomes brittle and fragile after 2d4 rounds, cracking apart and losing its effectiveness. An application of <a class=\"magic-item\" href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/wondrous-items/wondrous-items/r-z/universal-solvent\">universal solvent</a> to a stuck creature dissolves the alchemical goo immediately.</p>\r\n<p class=\"header\">Alchemical Power Component</p>\r\n<p class=\"source\"><b>Source</b> <a title=\"PZO9410\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1601252226/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1601252226&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwd20pfs-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PZO9410</a></p>\r\n<p>Tanglefoot bags can make troublesome spells even worse when used as a power component.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><a class=\"spell\" href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/black-tentacles\">Black Tentacles</a> (M): For each tanglefoot bag used as a power component, you may reroll the tentacles' <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple\">grapple</a> check against one creature of your choice.</li>\r\n<li><a class=\"spell\" href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/slow\">Slow</a> (M): For each tangelefoot bag used as a power component, you may designate one slowed creature as being affected by a tanglefoot bag.</li>\r\n<li><a class=\"spell\" href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/w/web\">Web</a> (M): Increase the DC of breaking free by making a <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers\">combat maneuver</a> or <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/escape-artist\">Escape Artist</a> check by 1.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n",
