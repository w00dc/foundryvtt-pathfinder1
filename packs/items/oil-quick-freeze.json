When poured over water, the oil pools on the surface and takes 1 round to spread out from the point of origin in a 20-foot radius. At the end of this round, the oil flash-freezes the surface of the water, creating an ice sheet over the affected area. Any 5-foot square of this ice can support up to 200 pounds of weight. Weight in excess of this amount causes the entire sheet to crack and quickly break up. This ice sheet becomes unstable and breaks up on its own after 1 hour, or 20 minutes in a hot climate. Any creature whose bare skin comes in contact with this oil takes 1d6 points of <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage\">nonlethal damage</a> each round because of the chemical's volatile nature, but the oil is ineffective as a <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Throw-Splash-Weapon\">splash weapon</a>.</p>\r\n",
