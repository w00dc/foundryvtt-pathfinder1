      "value": "<h4><span id=\"Candle\"><a name=\"TOC-Candle\"></a>Candle</span></h4>\r\n<p>A candle dimly illuminates a small area, increasing the light level in a 5-foot radius by one step (darkness becomes dim light and dim light becomes normal light). A candle cannot increase the light level above normal light. A candle burns for 1 hour. <b>Price</b> 1 cp; <b>Weight</b> -</p>\r\n<p><b>Candle, Helmet</b> This device consists of a helmet with a short, thin spike on top upon which a <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/hunting-camping-survival-geaR/#TOC-Candle\">candle</a> is stuck, freeing your hands for other tasks. <b>Price</b> 2 gp; <b>Weight</b> 4 lbs.</p>\r\n<p><b>Candle Lamp</b> A candle lamp is a small lantern-like device with glass panels and a slot to hold a <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/hunting-camping-survival-geaR/#TOC-Candle\">candle</a>. It protects the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/hunting-camping-survival-geaR/#TOC-Candle\">candle</a> from drafts and catches wax drippings. It provides the same light as a <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/hunting-camping-survival-geaR/#TOC-Candle\">candle</a>, but can be shuttered such that it only illuminates 1 to 3 adjacent squares. You can use a <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/hunting-camping-survival-geaR/#TOC-Candle-Lamp\">candle lamp</a> to keep your hands warm. <b>Price</b> 5 gp; <b>Weight</b> 1 lb.</p>\r\n<p><b>Candlestick</b> This saucer-like object has a flat bottom, a handle, and a spike on top. You can affix a <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/hunting-camping-survival-geaR/#TOC-Candle\">candle</a> onto the spike (up to 3 inches in diameter) and hold the candlestick by the handle. The flat bottom means you're able to set it down and not worry about the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/hunting-camping-survival-geaR/#TOC-Candle\">candle</a> falling over and extinguishing itself. A typical candlestick is crafted from baked <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/hunting-camping-survival-geaR/#TOC-Clay\">clay</a> or a cheap metal such as copper, but elaborate and expensive ones exist. <b>Price</b> 1 cp; <b>Weight</b> 1/2 lb.</p>\r\n",
