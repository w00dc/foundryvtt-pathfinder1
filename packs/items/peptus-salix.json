A vial taken in small doses during the day, alleviates these symptoms. If you drink an entire vial, for 1 hour you get a +2 <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Bonus-Alchemical-\">alchemical bonus</a> on <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude\">Fortitude</a> saving throws against effects that inflict the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated\">nauseated</a> or <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Sickened\">sickened</a> condition. If you drink a vial of it while suffering from the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Nauseated\">nauseated</a> or <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Sickened\">sickened</a> condition, you may immediately roll another saving throw (with the +2 bonus) against the effect; you may gain this particular benefit only once per day. Drinking a vial (whether over the course of a day or all at once) usually turns your tongue black for about a day, though this is a harmless side effect.</p>\r\n",
