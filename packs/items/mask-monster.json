The mouth opens and closes when you move your jaw and its skin is actually carefully-painted cloth. Though such masks are usually intended for theater performances where an actor plays the role of a monster, adventurers have been known to use them to help blend in with monsters of the appropriate type. The mask negates the -2 <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/disguise\">Disguise</a> DC for disguising yourself as a different race, but only at a distance of at least 20 feet or when you have <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Concealment\">concealment</a>; closer than this distance or in clearer circumstances, the mask is obviously a false representation. It only covers your face and is normally worn with a wig or helmet to disguise or cover the rest of your head. Each mask is most suitable for a wearer of a particular size, though some size and monster combinations are less believable than others (a Small creature in an orc mask may be able to pass as an <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/featured-races/arg-orc\">orc</a> child, but a Medium creature in a goblin mask at best looks like a deformed <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/featured-races/arg-hobgoblin\">hobgoblin</a>).</p> \n",
