A bullseye lantern does not increase the light level in normal light or bright light. A lantern burns for 6 hours on 1 pint of <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/hunting-camping-survival-geaR/#TOC-Oil\">oil</a>. You can carry a lantern in one hand. <b>Price</b> 12 gp; <b>Weight</b> 3 lbs.</p>\r\n<p><b>Darklight Lantern</b> This lantern does not burn oil, but instead burns shadowcloy. When shadowcloy is used as its fuel, this lantern creates a strange, hazy darkness that decreases the light level for 30 feet around it by one step. Unlike when shadowcloy is thrown at a single target, this haze does not decrease natural darkness to <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Supernatural-Abilities-Su-\">supernatural</a> darkness. One flask of shadowcloy fuels a darklight lantern for 1 minute. <b>Source</b> <a title=\"PZO1121\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1601253907/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1601253907&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwd20pfs-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PZO1121</a></p>\r\n<p><b>Hooded Lantern</b> A hooded lantern sheds normal light in a 30-foot radius and increases the light level by one step for an additional 30 feet beyond that area (darkness becomes dim light and dim light becomes normal light). A hooded lantern does not increase the light level in normal light or bright light.

A miner's lantern does not increase the light level in normal light or bright light. It burns for 6 hours on 1 pint of oil. A miner's lantern comes with straps for attachment to a helmet or other piece of sturdy headgear, but it can also be carried in one hand. <b>Source</b> <a title=\"PCS:PSFG\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1601253052/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1601253052&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=httpwwwd20pfs-20\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PCS:PSFG</a></p>\r\n<p><b>Waterproof Lantern</b> Meant to shelter its flame from both water and wind, this lantern treats severe winds as strong winds, windstorms as severe winds, and hurricanes as windstorms for the purpose of determining whether they extinguish its flame. It holds enough air to burn underwater for 5 rounds before going dark. <b>Price</b> +5 gp; <b>Weight</b> -</p>\r\n",
