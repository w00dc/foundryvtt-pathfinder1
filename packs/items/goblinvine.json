Creatures with the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Goblinoid\">goblinoid</a> subtype are immune to goblinvine.</p>\r\n<p><b>Gather</b> DC 16; <b>Yield</b> 1 dose (1 lb.)</p>\r\n<p><b>Terrain</b> any forests, mountains, plains, or swamps</p>\r\n<p><b>Preparation</b> Properly preparing a dose of goblinvine requires a successful DC 20 <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/sleight-of-hand\">Sleight of Hand</a> check and 1 minute of work to weave and roll the vines into a compact, fist-sized ball so the hairy side of the leaves faces inward. On a failure by 5 or more, the leaves become torn and ruined. If gloves or gauntlets aren't worn, the preparer is automatically exposed to the goblinvine's effects. If the preparation check's result is a natural 1, the preparer is exposed to those effects regardless of any hand protection worn. The <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/races/other-races/featured-races/arg-goblin\">goblin</a> vine must then be stored in an area of bright light for at least 1 hour for the inner surface of the leaves to properly &#8220;sweat&#8221; and build up enough irritating oil to function as a thrown weapon.</p>\r\n<p><b>Use</b> Once woven into a tight ball of vines and left to sweat, a ball of goblinvine leaves can be used as an improvised thrown weapon as a ranged <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks\">touch attack</a>. On a hit, a target must succeed at a DC 10 <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude\">Fortitude</a> save or develop a distracting, itchy rash that imposes a -2 penalty on ability checks, <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack rolls</a>, saving throws, and skill checks. This effect persists for 10 minutes or until the rash is tended with a successful DC 12 <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/heal\">Heal</a> check attempted as a <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions\">full-round action</a>. This is a <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/afflictions/poison\">poison</a> effect, but creatures with the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Goblinoid\">goblinoid</a> subtype are immune to the effect. Innovative characters (including many <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/humanoids/goblin\">goblins</a>) have developed other uses for goblinvine, including as snares and ropes to make those bound or <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Entangled\">entangled</a> itchy as well, but since goblinvine is relatively fragile, it makes for a very poor substitute for <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/hunting-camping-survival-gear#TOC-Rope\">rope</a>.</p>\r\n",
