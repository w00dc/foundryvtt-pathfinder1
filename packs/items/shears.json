Small shears can be used in one hand and are often used to trim hair, cut cloth, or perform other delicate cutting work. Lopping shears are 3 feet long and must be used in two hands; they are commonly used by farmers or gardeners to cut hedges and branches.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials#TOC-Adamantine\">Adamantine</a> shears are lopping shears with sharpened <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials#TOC-Adamantine\">adamantine</a> blades that can snip through nearly any material.</p>\r\n<p>You can use <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials#TOC-Adamantine\">adamantine</a> shears to cut through bars, chains, grates, or similar items, dealing damage to such objects as though using a <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/scimitar\">scimitar</a> and bypassing <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/damaging-objects#TOC-Hardness\">hardness</a> less than 20.</p>\r\n<p>On any item the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials#TOC-Adamantine\">adamantine</a> shears can fit around (such as a <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/tools-kits#TOC-Chain\">chain</a> or iron bar, but not an iron door), using <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials#TOC-Adamantine\">adamantine</a> shears provides a +10 bonus on your <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-\">Strength</a> check to break or burst it.</p>\r\n\r\n",
