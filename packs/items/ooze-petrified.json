When the cover is removed and the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze\">ooze</a> is exposed to air, the user has 1 minute to handle the rapidly softening <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze\">ooze</a> before it regains its former viscosity (as well as toxicity) and springs back to life. Although much smaller than an actual <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze\">ooze</a> creature, this coin-sized blob still deals 1d6 points of acid damage to anything it comes in contact with. Due to its unpredictable nature, <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Petrified\">petrified</a> <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze\">ooze</a> is typically only good for breaking or melting whatever object or device on which the user originally sets the ooze, after which the blob quickly scurries into the nearest corner or crevice so it can feed on particles of dust and diminutive prey. Once restored to its viscous form, a <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Petrified\">petrified</a> <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze\">ooze</a> moves at a rate of 60 feet per round, and any creature that comes in contact with the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Ooze\">ooze</a> must succeed at a DC 12 <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex\">Reflex</a> save to avoid taking acid damage from it.</p>\r\n",
