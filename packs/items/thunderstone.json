When it strikes a hard surface (or is struck hard), it creates a deafening bang that is treated as a sonic attack. Each creature within a 10-foot-radius spread must make a DC 15 <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude\">Fortitude</a> save or be <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Deafened\">deafened</a> for 1 hour. A <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Deafened\">deafened</a> creature, in addition to the obvious effects, takes a -4 penalty on <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Initiative\">initiative</a> and has a 20% chance to miscast and lose any spell with a verbal component that it tries to cast.</p>\r\n<p>Since you don't need to hit a specific target, you can simply aim at a particular 5-foot square.
