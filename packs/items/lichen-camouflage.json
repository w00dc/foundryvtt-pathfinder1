Where other races would be appalled at the thought of plants taking root in their flesh, <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/oread\">oreads</a> see it as a natural and healthy extension of their elemental nature. For this reason, <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/oread\">oread</a> herbalists developed several strains of moss and lichen specifically adapted to grow on their bodies. Camouflage lichen is the most common variety of these <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/oread\">oread</a> plants. It takes 1 minute to apply a paste of camouflage lichen spores to the skin, and an additional 24 hours for the fungus to sprout. After this time, the <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/oread\">oread</a> is covered in a thin green layer of living plant matter, granting her a +4 bonus on <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/stealth\">Stealth</a> checks made in green forest and jungle environments. Red-orange and white varieties exist, providing bonuses in appropriately colored environments (red-orange among autumn leaves or in red deserts, white in snow, and so on). Camouflage lichen has a short lifespan; it withers and dies 3 days after being applied, crumbling away into harmless powder. This item only works on <a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/oread\">oreads</a> and other creatures with rock-like bodies.</p>\r\n",
