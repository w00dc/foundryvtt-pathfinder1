Like the <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.skills\" data-id=\"L6LEhHRrn53cMuhE\"> Craft</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.skills\" data-id=\"HhV5UmaRLTjtB3Xh\"> Perform</a>, and <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.skills\" data-id=\"O7Utk8xKbHYDP7Ot\"> Profession</a> skills, Knowledge actually encompasses a number of different specialties. Below are listed typical fields of study.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Arcana</strong> (ancient mysteries, magic traditions, arcane symbols, constructs, dragons, magical beasts)</li>\n<li><strong>Dungeoneering</strong> (aberrations, caverns, oozes, spelunking)</li>\n<li><strong>Engineering</strong> (buildings, aqueducts, bridges, fortifications)</li>\n<li><strong>Geography</strong> (lands, terrain, climate, people)</li>\n<li><strong>History</strong> (wars, colonies, migrations, founding of cities)</li>\n<li><strong>Local</strong> (legends, personalities, inhabitants, laws, customs, traditions, humanoids)</li>\n<li><strong>Nature</strong> (animals, fey, monstrous humanoids, plants, seasons and cycles, weather, vermin)</li>\n<li><strong>Nobility</strong> (lineages, heraldry, personalities, royalty)</li>\n<li><strong>Planes</strong> (the Inner Planes, the Outer Planes, the Astral Plane, the Ethereal Plane, outsiders, planar magic)</li>\n<li><strong>Religion</strong> (gods and goddesses, mythic history, ecclesiastic tradition, holy symbols, undead)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Check:</strong> Answering a question within your field of study has a DC of 10 (for really easy questions), 15 (for basic questions), or 20 to 30 (for really tough questions).</p>\n<p>You can use this skill to identify monsters and their special powers or vulnerabilities. In general, the DC of such a check equals 10 + the monster’s CR. For common monsters, such as goblins, the DC of this check equals 5 + the monster’s CR. For particularly rare monsters, such as the tarrasque, the DC of this check equals 15 + the monster’s CR, or more. A successful check allows you to remember a bit of useful information about that monster. For every 5 points by which your check result exceeds the DC, you recall another piece of useful information. Many of the Knowledge skills have specific uses as noted on the below table.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td scope=\"col\">Task</td>\n<td scope=\"col\">Knowledge Skill</td>\n<td scope=\"col\">DC</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Identify auras while using detect magic</td>\n<td>Arcana</td>\n<td>15 + spell level</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Identify a spell effect that is in place</td>\n<td>Arcana</td>\n<td>20 + spell level</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Identify materials manufactured by magic</td>\n<td>Arcana</td>\n<td>20 + spell level</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Identify a spell that just targeted you</td>\n<td>Arcana</td>\n<td>25 + spell level</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Identify the spells cast using a specific material component</td>\n<td>Arcana</td>\n<td>20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Identify underground hazard</td>\n<td>Dungeoneering</td>\n<td>15 + hazard’s CR</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Identify mineral, stone, or metal</td>\n<td>Dungeoneering</td>\n<td>10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Determine slope</td>\n<td>Dungeoneering</td>\n<td>15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Determine depth underground</td>\n<td>Dungeoneering</td>\n<td>20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Identify dangerous construction</td>\n<td>Engineering</td>\n<td>10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Determine a structure’s style or age</td>\n<td>Engineering</td>\n<td>15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Determine a structure’s weakness</td>\n<td>Engineering</td>\n<td>20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Identify a creature’s ethnicity or accent</td>\n<td>Geography</td>\n<td>10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Recognize regional terrain features</td>\n<td>Geography</td>\n<td>15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Know location of nearest community or noteworthy site</td>\n<td>Geography</td>\n<td>20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Know recent or historically significant event</td>\n<td>History</td>\n<td>10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Determine approximate date of a specific event</td>\n<td>History</td>\n<td>15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Know obscure or ancient historical event</td>\n<td>History</td>\n<td>20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Know local laws, rulers, and popular locations</td>\n<td>Local</td>\n<td>10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Know a common rumor or local tradition</td>\n<td>Local</td>\n<td>15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Know hidden organizations, rulers, and locations</td>\n<td>Local</td>\n<td>20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Identify natural hazard</td>\n<td>Nature</td>\n<td>15 + hazard’s CR</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Identify a common plant or animal</td>\n<td>Nature</td>\n<td>10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Identify unnatural weather phenomenon</td>\n<td>Nature</td>\n<td>15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Determine artificial nature of feature</td>\n<td>Nature</td>\n<td>20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Know current rulers and their symbols</td>\n<td>Nobility</td>\n<td>10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Know proper etiquette</td>\n<td>Nobility</td>\n<td>15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Know line of succession</td>\n<td>Nobility</td>\n<td>20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Know the names of the planes</td>\n<td>Planes</td>\n<td>10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Recognize current plane</td>\n<td>Planes</td>\n<td>15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Identify a creature’s planar origin</td>\n<td>Planes</td>\n<td>20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Recognize a common deity’s symbol or clergy</td>\n<td>Religion</td>\n<td>10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Know common mythology and tenets</td>\n<td>Religion</td>\n<td>15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Recognize an obscure deity’s symbol or clergy</td>\n<td>Religion</td>\n<td>20</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Identify a monster’s abilities and weaknesses</td>\n<td>Varies</td>\n<td>10 + monster’s CR</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>Action:</strong> Usually none. In most cases, a Knowledge check doesn’t take an action (but see \"Untrained,\" below).</p>\n<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> No. The check represents what you know, and thinking about a topic a second time doesn’t let you know something that you never learned in the first place.</p>\n<p><strong>Untrained:</strong> You cannot make an untrained Knowledge check with a DC higher than 10. If you have access to an extensive library that covers a specific skill, this limit is removed. The time to make checks using a library, however, increases to 1d4 hours. Particularly complete libraries might even grant a bonus on Knowledge checks in the fields that they cover.</p>\n<h1>Phrenology (Arcana)</h1>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9egu?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Occult-Adventures\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Occult Adventures pg. 196</a><br>You examine the skulls of intelligent creatures to analyze the subjects’ psychological attributes, since the shape of the brain influences the shape of the skull.</p>\n<p><strong>Check:</strong> Once per day, you can use your fingertips to examine the shape of a creature’s skull. Reading a creature’s skull requires 1 minute of concentration and scrutiny while you physically manipulate the skull. This technique can be used on a willing, helpless, or paralyzed creature, or on decomposed remains (as long as the skull is intact or can be pieced together). This skill can’t be used on creatures without discernible skulls, such as constructs, elementals, oozes, or plants. After the minute is up, the GM attempts a secret Knowledge (arcana) check. The DC is typically modified by the subject’s Hit Dice. With a single check, you determine all the information whose DC you meet. For instance, if you had a result of 22 when examining a creature with 2 HD, you would learn that creature’s race and age, gender, alignment, and class, but not its level or HD.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td scope=\"col\">Task</td>\n<td scope=\"col\">DC</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Determine race and age</td>\n<td>10</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Determine gender</td>\n<td>15</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Determine alignment</td>\n<td>15 + creature’s HD<sup>†</sup></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Determine class</td>\n<td>20 + creature’s HD<sup>†</sup></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Determine level or HD</td>\n<td>25 + creature’s HD<sup>†</sup></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><sup>† A dead creature’s skull uses the HD the creature had when alive.</sup></p>\n<p><strong>Action:</strong> Reading a creature’s cranium requires 1 minute of uninterrupted study.</p>\n<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> Yes. Reexamining a skull may provide new insights. You can attempt only one such check per day.</p>\n<h2>Occult Skill Unlocks</h2>\n<p>Characters capable of casting psychic spells or who have the Psychic Sensitivity feat gain access to skill unlocks—a host of esoteric skill uses not available to other PCs. These are not entirely new skills, but rather new uses of existing skills for those trained in the occult arts. A character must be trained in the appropriate skill to use that skill’s unlock, even if the skill can normally be used untrained. It’s impossible to take 10 for an occult skill unlock. Occult skill unlocks require intense concentration and strenuous effort, so the amount a character can use each skill unlock is limited to once per day or per week. This limit is for all uses of the skill unlock; if a character uses hypnotism to implant a suggestion, he can’t also use it to recall memories on the same day.</p>\n<h1>Recall Intrigues</h1>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9l2w?Pathfinder-Player-Companion-Spymasters-Handbook\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Spymaster's Handbook pg. 9</a><br>You can identify feats and the class features of various classes with successful Knowledge checks when you observe the feats or class features being used.</p>\n<p><strong>Check:</strong> You can attempt a skill check to identify a feat or class feature when you observe it in use, similar to how Spellcraft can be used to identify a spell. The feat or class feature must have some observable effect in order for you to attempt the Knowledge check. For example, you can’t see the internal determination of <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.feats\" data-id=\"iAbIGhm7T2OK9Brt\"> Iron Will</a>, so this ability can’t identify that feat. In general, if a feat or class feature creates a noticeable effect (such as the extra attack from using <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.feats\" data-id=\"Zeq6RWYv5otvg8q7\"> Cleave</a>) or has a variable modifier a character must choose to use (such as <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.feats\" data-id=\"QvlxYVVsBDlykPKe\"> Arcane Strike</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.feats\" data-id=\"NFxHebU1XhEs5WJh\"> Combat Expertise</a>, or <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.feats\" data-id=\"9mcYid7xJY9NiySx\"> Enlarge Spell</a>), it can be identified. If it creates a static bonus (such as <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.feats\" data-id=\"JreaiTHdyWFNj3Tb\"> Dodge</a> or <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.feats\" data-id=\"0bZf3SDkvVOe2ujH\"> Lightning Reflexes</a>), there’s no telltale sign to give it away.</p>\n<p>The Knowledge skill required to identify a feat or class feature varies depending on the type of feat or class feature to be identified and is outlined in the table below, along with the DCs of such skill checks.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td scope=\"col\">Task</td>\n<td scope=\"col\">Knowledge Skill</td>\n<td scope=\"col\">DC</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Identify a class feature from a class that grants arcane or psychic spells</td>\n<td>Arcana</td>\n<td>10 + class level when feature is granted*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Identify a class feature from a class with access to the druid or ranger spell list</td>\n<td>Nature</td>\n<td>10 + class level when feature is granted*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Identify a class feature from another class that grants divine spells</td>\n<td>Religion</td>\n<td>10 + class level when feature is granted*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Identify a class feature from any other class</td>\n<td>Local</td>\n<td>10 + class level when feature is granted*</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Identify a combat feat being used</td>\n<td>Local</td>\n<td>10 + character’s level</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Identify a metamagic feat being used</td>\n<td>Arcana</td>\n<td>10 + character’s level</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Identify a teamwork feat being used</td>\n<td>Nobility</td>\n<td>10 + character’s level</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Identify any other feat being used</td>\n<td>Local</td>\n<td>15 + character’s level</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><sup>* Add 10 to the DC if the class is a prestige class.</sup></p>\n<h1>Researching Technology</h1>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy95d2?Pathfinder-Campaign-Setting-Technology-Guide\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Technology Guide pg. 5</a><br>A character can use the following skills to research technological subjects.

Knowledge (engineering) can be used to identify a robot’s abilities and weaknesses.
