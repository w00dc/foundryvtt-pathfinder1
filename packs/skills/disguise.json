If you come to the attention of people who are suspicious (such as a guard who is watching commoners walking through a city gate), it can be assumed that such observers are taking 10 on their <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.skills\" data-id=\"YYmmxDgp0g3ltSUG\"><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i> Perception</a> checks.</p>\n<p>You get only one Disguise check per use of the skill, even if several people make <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.skills\" data-id=\"YYmmxDgp0g3ltSUG\"><i class=\"fas fa-book-open\"></i> Perception</a> checks against it. The Disguise check is made secretly, so that you can’t be sure how good the result is.</p>\n<p>The effectiveness of your disguise depends on how much you’re changing your appearance. Disguise can be used to make yourself appear like a creature that is one size category larger or smaller than your actual size. This does not change your actual size or reach, should you enter combat while wearing such a disguise.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td scope=\"col\">Disguise</td>\n<td scope=\"col\">Check Modifier</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Minor details only</td>\n<td>+5</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Disguised as different gender<sup>1</sup></td>\n<td>–2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Disguised as different race<sup>1</sup></td>\n<td>–2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Disguised as different age category<sup>1</sup></td>\n<td>–2<sup>2</sup></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Disguised as different size category<sup>1</sup></td>\n<td>–10</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><sup>1 These modifiers are cumulative; use all that apply.</sup><br><sup>2 Per step of difference between your actual age category and your disguised age category.

If you casually meet a large number of different creatures, each for a short time, check once per day or hour, using an average Perception modifier for the group.</p>\n<p><strong>Action:</strong> Creating a disguise requires 1d3 × 10 minutes of work. Using magic (such as the <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.spells\" data-id=\"oj36nfak6jc2s5ky\"> Disguise Self</a> spell) reduces this action to the time required to cast the spell or trigger the effect.</p>\n<p><strong>Try Again:</strong> Yes. You may try to redo a failed disguise, but once others know that a disguise was attempted, they’ll be more suspicious.</p>\n<p><strong>Special:</strong> Magic that alters your form, such as <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.spells\" data-id=\"kouqz0pm1xl8xilm\"> Alter Self</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.spells\" data-id=\"oj36nfak6jc2s5ky\"> Disguise Self</a>, <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.spells\" data-id=\"d40ia71c2eljm91k\"> Polymorph</a>, or <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.spells\" data-id=\"n3lp01euzcdmtbw5\"> Shapechange</a>, grants you a +10 bonus on Disguise checks (see the individual spell descriptions). Divination magic that allows people to see through illusions (such as true seeing) does not penetrate a mundane disguise, but it can negate the magical component of a magically enhanced one.</p>\n<p>You must make a Disguise check when you cast a simulacrum spell to determine how good the likeness is.</p>\n<p>If you have the <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"pf1.feats\" data-id=\"SUACufUXl12sUvnQ\"> Deceitful</a> feat, you gain a bonus on Disguise checks (see Feats).</p>\n<h1>Unchained - Skill Unlock</h1>\n<p><strong>Source</strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://paizo.com/products/btpy9c25?Pathfinder-Roleplaying-Game-Pathfinder-Unchained\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Pathfinder Unchained pg. 83</a><br>With sufficient ranks in Disguise, you earn the following.</p>\n<p><strong>5 Ranks:</strong> You can create a disguise in 1d3 minutes.</p>\n<p><strong>10 Ranks:</strong> You can create a disguise in 1d3 rounds.
