Creatures that have negative&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points\">hit points</a>&nbsp;and have not stabilized are dying. A dying creature can take no actions. On the character&rsquo;s next turn, after being reduced to negative&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points\">hit points</a>&nbsp;(but not @Compendium[pf1.conditions.khxmbfoDQ3LD0de5]{Dead}), and on all subsequent turns, the character must make a DC 10&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-\">Constitution</a>&nbsp;check to become&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/Gamemastering/Conditions/#TOC-Stable\">stable</a>. The character takes a penalty on this roll equal to his negative hit point total. A character that is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/Gamemastering/Conditions/#TOC-Stable\">stable</a>&nbsp;does not need to make this check. A natural 20 on this check is an automatic success. If the character fails this check, he loses 1 hit point. If a dying creature has an amount of negative&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points\">hit points</a>&nbsp;equal to its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-\">Constitution</a>&nbsp;score, it dies.</p>"
