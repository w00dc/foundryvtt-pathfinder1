A disabled character may take a single&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions\">move action</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>&nbsp;each round (but not both, nor can he take full-round actions, but he can still take swift, immediate, and free actions). He moves at half speed. Taking move actions doesn&rsquo;t risk further injury, but performing any&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>&nbsp;(or any other action the GM deems strenuous, including some free actions such as casting a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/metamagic-feats/quicken-spell-metamagic\">Quicken Spell</a>&nbsp;spell) deals 1 point of damage after the completion of the act. Unless the action increased the disabled character&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points\">hit points</a>, he is now in negative&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points\">hit points</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/Gamemastering/Conditions/#TOC-Dying\">dying</a>.</p>\n<p>A disabled character with negative&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points\">hit points</a>&nbsp;recovers&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points\">hit points</a>&nbsp;naturally if he is being helped. Otherwise, each day he can attempt a DC 10&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-\">Constitution</a>&nbsp;check after resting for 8 hours, to begin recovering&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points\">hit points</a>&nbsp;naturally. The character takes a penalty on this roll equal to his negative hit point total. Failing this check causes the character to lose 1 hit point, but this does not cause the character to become @Compendium[pf1.conditions.bj36eCfZGJG5AGTQ]{Unconscious}. Once a character makes this check, he continues to heal naturally and is no longer in danger of losing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points\">hit points</a>&nbsp;naturally.</p>"
