A sinking ship cannot move or attack, and it sinks completely 10 rounds after it gains the sinking condition. Each additional hit on a sinking ship that deals more than 25 points of damage reduces the remaining time for it to sink by 1 round. A ship that sinks completely drops to the bottom of the body of water and is considered destroyed. A destroyed ship cannot be repaired—it is so significantly damaged it cannot even be used for scrap material. Magic (such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/m/make-whole\">make whole</a>) can repair a sinking ship if the ship’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points\">hit points</a>&nbsp;are raised above 0, at which point the ship loses the sinking condition. Generally, non-magical repairs take too long to save a ship from sinking once it begins to go down.</p>"
