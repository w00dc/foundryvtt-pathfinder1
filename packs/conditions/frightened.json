A frightened creature takes a &ndash;2 penalty on all attack rolls,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws\">saving throws</a>, skill checks, and ability checks. A frightened creature can use special abilities, including spells, to flee; indeed, the creature must use such means if they are the only way to escape.</p>\n<p>Frightened is like @Compendium[pf1.conditions.07JPXUqIPshVnTCL]{Shaken}, except that the creature must flee if possible. Panicked is a more extreme state of fear.</p>"
