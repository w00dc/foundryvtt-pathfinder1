A helpless target is treated as having a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a> of 0 (&ndash;5 modifier). Melee attacks against a helpless target get a +4 bonus (equivalent to attacking a @Compendium[pf1.conditions.Av5KcblR1Wd68uWY]{Prone} target). Ranged attacks get no special bonus against helpless targets. Rogues can sneak attack helpless targets.</p>\n<p>As a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions\">full-round action</a>, an enemy can use a melee weapon to deliver a coup de grace to a helpless foe. An enemy can also use a bow or crossbow, provided he is adjacent to the target. The attacker automatically hits and scores a critical hit. (A @Compendium[pf1.classes.xIU4bfj8WoVNCkcl]{Rogue}&nbsp;also gets his sneak attack damage bonus against a helpless foe when delivering a coup de grace.) If the defender survives, he must make a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude\">Fortitude</a>&nbsp;save (DC 10 + damage dealt) or die. Delivering a coup de grace provokes attacks of opportunity.</p>\n<p>Creatures that are immune to critical hits do not take critical damage, nor do they need to make&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude\">Fortitude</a>&nbsp;saves to avoid being killed by a coup de grace.</p>"
