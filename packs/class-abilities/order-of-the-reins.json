      "value": "<p>The cavaliers of the order of the reins hold a strong rapport not just with their mounts, but with all tamed and domesticated animals on Golarion. From camels and horses to teams of sled dogs, these cavaliers hold themselves honor-bound to protect these creatures for their labor and loyalty. Cavaliers of the order of the reins often serve as the commanders of caravans or other expeditions, using their unique skills to ensure that the caravan and its wares safely reach their intended markets.<br><br><strong>Edicts:</strong> The cavalier must do everything in his power to keep a caravan or traveling group safe once he has agreed to protect it. He must see that any allied animal injured under his watch is healed, or personally give it a merciful death if survival is not an option. He must not let any animal under his command suffer needlessly.<br><br><strong>Challenge:</strong> Whenever an order of the reins cavalier issues a challenge, all allied animals, animal companions, familiars, and mounts within 60 feet gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls and a +2 bonus to AC against the target. This bonus increases by 1 for every additional 4 levels the cavalier has.<br><br><strong>Skills:</strong> An order of the reins cavalier adds Appraise and Perception to his list of class skills. Any animal that the cavalier is riding can use the cavalierâ€™s Handle Animal modifier in place of its own Acrobatics and Swim skill modifiers as long as the cavalier is mounted on it.</p>",
