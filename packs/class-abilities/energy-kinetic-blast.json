      "value": "<p>At 1st level, a kineticist gains a kinetic blast wild talent of her choice. This kinetic blast must be a simple blast that matches her element. Simple blasts are listed with their corresponding&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/occult-adventures/occult-classes/kineticist/kineticist-elements/\">elements</a>.</p>\n<p>As a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>, the kineticist can unleash a kinetic blast at a single target up to a range of 30 feet. She must have at least one hand free to aim the blast (or one prehensile appendage, if she doesn’t have hands). All damage from a kinetic blast is treated as magic for the purpose of bypassing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction\">damage reduction</a>. Kinetic blasts count as a type of weapon for the purpose of feats such as @Compendium[pf1.feats.n250dFlbykAIAg5Z]{Weapon Focus}. The kineticist is never considered to be wielding or gripping the kinetic blast (regardless of effects from form infusions; see Infusion), and she can’t use @Compendium[pf1.feats.26k1Gi7t5BoqxhIj]{Vital Strike}&nbsp;feats with kinetic blasts. Even the weakest kinetic blast involves a sizable mass of elemental matter or energy, so kinetic blasts always deal full damage to swarms of any size (though only area blasts deal extra damage to swarms). A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Ready\">readied</a>&nbsp;kinetic blast can be used to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Counterspells\">counterspell</a>&nbsp;any spell of equal or lower level that shares its descriptor. A kinetic blast that deals energy damage of any type (including force) has the corresponding descriptor.</p>\n<p>Each simple blast is either a physical blast or an energy blast.</p>\n<p>Physical blasts are ranged attacks that deal an amount of damage equal to 1d6+1 + the kineticist’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-\">Constitution</a>&nbsp;modifier, increasing by 1d6+1 for every 2 kineticist levels beyond 1st. Spell resistance doesn’t apply against physical blasts.</p>\n<p>Energy blasts are ranged touch attacks that deal an amount of damage equal to 1d6 + 1/2 the kineticist’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-\">Constitution</a>&nbsp;modifier, increasing by 1d6 for every 2 kineticist levels beyond 1st.</p>\n<p>Composite blasts combine elements to form a new blast. When a kineticist gains a new element through&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/occult-adventures/occult-classes/kineticist/#TOC-Expanded-Element-Su-\">expanded element</a>, she gains access to all composite blasts for which she qualifies. All composite blasts are listed after the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/occult-adventures/occult-classes/kineticist/kineticist-elements/#TOC-Composite-Blasts\">kineticist elements</a>.</p>\n<p>Most composite blasts are either physical or energy blasts, like simple blasts.</p>\n<p>Physical composite blasts deal an amount of damage equal to 2d6+2 + the kineticist’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-\">Constitution</a>&nbsp;modifier, increasing by 2d6+2 for every 2 kineticist levels beyond 1st.</p>\n<p>Energy composite blasts deal an amount of damage equal to 2d6 + 1/2 the kineticist’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-\">Constitution</a>&nbsp;modifier, increasing by 2d6 for every 2 kineticist levels beyond 1st.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A complete listing of kinetic blasts and composite blasts can be found within the Kineticist Elements page, here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/alternative-rule-systems/occult-adventures/occult-classes/kineticist/kineticist-elements/\">Kineticist Elements</a></li>\n</ul>",
