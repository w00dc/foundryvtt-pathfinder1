      "value": "<p>The arcanist can, as a swift action while he casts a spell that targets one living creature, spend 1 point from his arcane reservoir to infuse his spell with a manifestation of fiendish energy called a “soulrider.” The soulrider attaches to the target of the spell and buries itself in the target’s subconscious mind, persisting there as long as the arcanist maintains at least 1 point in his arcane reservoir, until the arcanist dismisses the soulrider (this requires a standard action), or until the arcanist successfully infects another creature with a soulrider. The target of the spell can resist having the soulrider attach to its soul with a successful Will saving throw (this is in addition to any saving throw the spell itself might or might not allow). If the target resists the spell’s effects with a successful save or other methods (such as via spell resistance or by being immune to that spell’s effects) the soulrider automatically fails to attach to the victim. @Compendium[pf1.spells.uqh87jz757r2cb7r]{Detect Magic}&nbsp;and @Compendium[pf1.spells.tr7m97npkbgm4wp7]{Detect Evil}&nbsp;can uncover the presence of a soulrider. As long as the soulrider persists, the arcanist can track the targeted creature as if it were under the effect of @Compendium[pf1.spells.4ya1fs9tyvsqnwqx]{Status}, and the creature takes a –2 penalty to any saving throw against a mind-affecting effect created by the arcanist. While the soulrider remains bonded to the target, the arcanist can spend 1 point from his arcane reservoir to communicate with the target as per @Compendium[pf1.spells.d0d86z521shpman1]{Sending}. Soulrider is a mind-affecting effect.</p>",
