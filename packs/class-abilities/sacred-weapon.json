      "value": "<p>At 1st level, weapons wielded by a warpriest are charged with the power of his faith. In addition to the favored weapon of his deity, the warpriest can designate a weapon as a sacred weapon by selecting that weapon with the Weapon Focus feat; if he has multiple Weapon Focus feats, this ability applies to all of them. Whenever the warpriest hits with his sacred weapon, the weapon damage is based on his level and not the weapon type. The damage for Medium warpriests is listed on Table 1–14; see the table below for Small and Large warpriests. The warpriest can decide to use the weapon’s base damage instead of the sacred weapon damage—this must be declared before the attack roll is made. (If the weapon’s base damage exceeds the sacred weapon damage, its damage is unchanged.) This increase in damage does not affect any other aspect of the weapon, and doesn’t apply to alchemical items, bombs, or other weapons that only deal energy damage.</p>\n<hr>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"border-color: white; color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Century Gothic', CenturyGothic, AppleGothic, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; background-color: #0f0f0f;\">\n<tbody style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">\n<tr style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center;\"><strong style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">Level</strong></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\"><strong style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">Damage (Small)</strong></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\"><strong style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">Damage (Large)</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background: #3e3e3e;\">\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center;\">1st-4th</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">1d4</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">1d8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center;\">5th-9th</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">1d6</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">2d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background: #3e3e3e;\">\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center;\">10th-14th</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">1d8</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">2d8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center;\">15th-19th</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">1d10</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">3d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background: #3e3e3e;\">\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center;\">20th</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">2d6</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">3d8</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr>\n<p><br style=\"color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Century Gothic', CenturyGothic, AppleGothic, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; background-color: #0f0f0f;\">At 4th level, the warpriest gains the ability to enhance one of his sacred weapons with divine power as a swift action. This power grants the weapon a +1 enhancement bonus. For every 4 levels beyond 4th, this bonus increases by 1 (to a maximum of +5 at 20th level). If the warpriest has more than one sacred weapon, he can enhance another on the following round by using another swift action. The warpriest can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to his warpriest level, but these rounds need not be consecutive.<br><br>These bonuses stack with any existing bonuses the weapon might have, to a maximum of +5. The warpriest can enhance a weapon with any of the following weapon special abilities:&nbsp;brilliant energy,&nbsp;defending,&nbsp;disruption,&nbsp;flaming,&nbsp;frost,&nbsp;keen, and&nbsp;shock. In addition, if the warpriest is chaotic, he can add&nbsp;anarchic&nbsp;and&nbsp;vicious. If he is evil, he can add&nbsp;mighty cleaving&nbsp;and&nbsp;unholy. If he is good, he can add&nbsp;ghost touch&nbsp;and&nbsp;holy. If he is lawful, he can add&nbsp;axiomatic&nbsp;and&nbsp;merciful. If he is neutral (with no other alignment components), he can add&nbsp;spell storing&nbsp;and&nbsp;thundering. Adding any of these special abilities replaces an amount of bonus equal to the special ability’s base cost (see Table 15–9 on page 469 of the&nbsp;Core Rulebook). Duplicate abilities do not stack. The weapon must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus before any other special abilities can be added.<br><br>If multiple weapons are enhanced, each one consumes rounds of use individually. The enhancement bonus and special abilities are determined the first time the ability is used each day, and cannot be changed until the next day. These bonuses do not apply if another creature is wielding the weapon, but they continue to be in effect if the weapon otherwise leaves the warpriest’s possession (such as if the weapon is thrown). This ability can be ended as a free action at the start of the warpriest’s turn (that round does not count against the total duration, unless the ability is resumed during the same round). If the warpriest uses this ability on a double weapon, the effects apply to only one end of the weapon.</p>",
