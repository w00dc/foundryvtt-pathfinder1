      "value": "<p>When the psychic gains this amplification, she chooses two metamagic feats; she need not have these feats to select them. When she casts a spell, she can spend points from her phrenic pool to apply one of the chosen feats to the linked spell without increasing the spell’s level or casting time. She must spend a number of points equal to double the number of levels by which the feat normally increases a spell’s level (minimum 2 points). If the metamagic feat alters the spell’s casting time in a different way than the standard rules for a spontaneous caster using a metamagic feat (as in the case of Quicken Spell), it changes the casting time accordingly. The psychic can still apply metamagic feats she knows to the spell while using this amplification, increasing the casting time and spell level as normal.</p>\n<p>This amplification can be applied only to a spell that the chosen metamagic feat could normally affect, and only if the spellcaster can cast spells of a high enough level that she would be able to apply the metamagic feat in question to the linked spell. For example, an 11th-level psychic could spend 8 points to quicken a 1st-level spell, but couldn’t quicken a 2nd-level spell because she’s unable to cast 6th-level spells. This ability doesn’t require her to have any free spell slots in the relevant level, however, so the psychic in the example could quicken a 1st-level spell even if she had cast all her 5th-level spells for the day.</p>\n<p>A psychic can select this amplification multiple times, adding two additional options to the list of metamagic feats she can apply using this amplification each time.</p>",
