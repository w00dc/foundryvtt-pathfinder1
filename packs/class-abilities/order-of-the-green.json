      "value": "<p>Cavaliers of the order of the Green are dedicated to protecting wild places and creatures, embracing the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/DeityDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Green%20Faith\">Green Faith</a>&nbsp;in all its glory and natural wonder.<br><br><strong>Edicts: </strong>The cavalier knows his place in the natural order and strives to defend the balance of nature. He must be willing to allow nature to take its course, and he must stop all those who would do harm to its delicate balance. He will not tolerate aberrant creatures, undead, or the irresponsible and greedy consumption of natural resources. He may be farsighted and seek to establish agreements that lead to lasting protection of the natural world, but resorts to violence if it is the most effective way to enforce such protection.<br><br><strong>Challenge:</strong> An order of the Green cavalier canâ€™t issue a challenge against any creature of the animal or plant type. Whenever he issues a challenge, he receives a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls against the target of his challenge. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels the cavalier has. If the target of his challenge is of the aberration or undead type, each round he can roll his first attack roll against the target creature twice and take the higher result.<br><br><strong>Skills: </strong>An order of the Green cavalier gains Knowledge (nature) and Survival as class skills. In addition, whenever an order of the Green cavalier attempts a Survival check to track foes of the aberration or undead type, he receives a bonus on the check equal to half his cavalier level (minimum +1).</p>",
