      "value": "<p>Cavaliers who join the order of the monument dedicate themselves to the protection and service of a particular city or settlement and often follow or respect the faiths of their home locale. Cavaliers belonging to this order hold themselves to their city’s laws and customs even when traveling abroad.<br><br><strong>Edicts: </strong>The cavalier must strive to protect the settlement, all those who reside within it, and those travelers who hail from it. He must adhere to the settlement’s laws even while away from its borders and promote its populace’s overarching ideals and values whenever possible.<br><br><strong>Challenge:</strong> Whenever an order of the monument cavalier issues a challenge, he gains a +1 dodge bonus to his AC against attacks made by the target of his challenge when the cavalier is flanked, as well as a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against fear and mind-affecting effects. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels the cavalier has.<br><br><strong>Skills:</strong> An order of the monument cavalier adds Knowledge (local) and Knowledge (religion) to his list of class skills. An order of the monument cavalier chooses one of these two skills. He can attempt skill checks with his chosen skill untrained. If he has ranks in the skill, he receives a bonus on the check equal to half his cavalier level (minimum +1) as long as the check involves his chosen settlement or a faith with a significant presence in his chosen settlement.</p>",
