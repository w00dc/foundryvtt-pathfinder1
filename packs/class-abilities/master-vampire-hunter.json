The DC for this save is 10 + 1/2 the vampire hunter’s level + the vampire hunter’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;modifier. Whether or not the attack succeeds, the creature cannot be targeted by this ability again (by any vampire hunter) for 24 hours.</p>\n<p>If the vampire hunter chooses to destroy the target, the target is killed. If the target is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/vampire\">vampire</a>, it does not assume&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/g/gaseous-form\">gaseous form</a>, and its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Conjuration-Healing\">healing</a>&nbsp;powers do not come into effect; it is destroyed outright. If the vampire hunter chooses to stake his target, the target is killed if it’s a non-<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/vampire\">vampire</a>. If it’s a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/templates/vampire\">vampire</a>&nbsp;(or similar creature affected by having a stake driven through its heart) it is killed, but returns to life if the stake is removed. The vampire hunter can use his 4th-level stake ability to employ any piercing weapon or sharp tool as though it were a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/stake-wooden\">wooden stake</a>.</p>\n<p>Additionally, at 20th level, each day when the vampire hunter regains his spells per day, he chooses one vampiric focus to be active on himself for the entire day. This focus is in addition to uses of his vampiric focus class ability.</p>",
