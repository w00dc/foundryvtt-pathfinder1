      "value": "<p><em>A shaman who selects the Dark Tapestry spirit is often a misanthropic loner. While she may well work with others, she rarely does so of her own volition. Instead, she seeks out the aid of a small group (such as a party of adventurers) as a result of an obscure vision or other influence from the Dark Tapestry that she might not fully comprehend. More often, though, a Dark Tapestry shaman is encountered not as a member of a group, but as the leader of a cult in a remote region—these shamans, of course, work best as NPC villains and not as PCs.</em><br><br><em>The spirits of the Dark Tapestry have often been known to whisper dangerous secrets to mortals who dwell on sane worlds. Such spirits might be found anywhere touched by the light of baleful stars, but they are most frequently found lurking around unfathomably ancient ruins of aberrant civilizations with links to the Dark Tapestry. On Golarion, these spirits can often be found near old ruins in Osirion or the Sodden Lands, although they are also quite active throughout the county of Versex in Ustalav. Many shamans who invoke the spirits of the Dark Tapestry also worship one or several of the Outer Gods or Great Old Ones of the Elder Mythos, be it out of fear or misinformed adoration. Other entities associated with the Dark Tapestry, particularly the Dominion of the Black, seem less likely to be associated with that realm’s spirits, so it may well be that the spirits that shamans call upon when they turn to the Dark Tapestry for power are in fact the idle thoughts of horrors such as Nyarlathotep, Yog-Sothoth, or even Azathoth.</em><br><br><strong>Spirit Magic Spells:</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1.spells.ja005kj1gh7g0dnk]{Entropic Shield} (1st),&nbsp;</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1.spells.gl524v9qd5jji2ex]{Contact Entity I} (2nd),&nbsp;</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1.spells.6g7x08y9nl7vlffv]{Contact Entity II} (3rd),&nbsp;</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1.spells.wralcmyi4tdcai24]{Black Tentacles} (4th),&nbsp;</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1.spells.0n789r9rokr1ktd1]{Contact Entity III} (5th),&nbsp;</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1.spells.66vvhyiy5q8yzbq2]{Feeblemind} (6th),&nbsp;</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1.spells.6kn3xjxysd4b3t6a]{Contact Entity IV} (7th),&nbsp;</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1.spells.s6q72tw2zra9sycu]{Insanity} (8th),&nbsp;</li>\n<li>@Compendium[pf1.spells.4qriqew7d2ot7wr5]{Interplanetary Teleport}&nbsp;(9th).</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Spirit Animal:</strong> The shaman’s spirit animal has an alien physiology, including twitching tentacles, additional but blind eyes, or strangely deformed limbs. The spirit animal gains the shaman’s choice of a swim speed or a climb speed equal to its highest speed, and one of its natural weapons increases in reach by 5 feet. If it did not have a natural weapon, it gains a tentacle attack as a secondary natural weapon with 5-foot reach. Damage for this tentacle is standard for a creature of the spirit animal’s size (1d2 for a Tiny spirit animal, or 1d3 for a Small one).</p>",
