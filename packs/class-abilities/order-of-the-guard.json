      "value": "<p>Cavaliers who join the order of the guard dedicate themselves to the staunch and unyielding protection of a specific person or object—generally one they have been hired to protect. Members of the order of the guard are often mercenaries, offering their valuable services for a fee to those who wish to protect their investments; this is especially in Druma, where many cavaliers belong to the illustrious and steadfast Blackjackets of the Mercenary League. An order of the guard cavalier can offer his services to a cause in which he believes without accepting a monetary payment, though the cavalier’s protection must come at some price, be it a favor, the release of knowledge, or other intangible trade. A tenet of the order is that the high level of protection the order strives for is only obtainable if the protector invests something of himself in the task and stands to lose something valuable should he fail.<br><br><strong>Edicts: </strong>An order of the guard cavalier must strive to protect his ward to the best of his ability, even if doing so costs the cavalier his life. The cavalier must always receive some compensation for his services, be it money, a favor, or other payment. A member of the order of the guard must carry out the orders stipulated in his contract or dictated by his employer as long as doing so does not violate other elements of the order’s code or a previously agreed upon contract.<br><br><strong>Challenge:</strong> At the start of each day, an order of the guard cavalier must declare a person or object (including an easily defined group of objects, such as a series of chests or a collection of books) that he is dedicated to protecting that day, typically the subject he has been hired to protect; the selected item is known as the cavalier’s ward. Whenever the cavalier issues a challenge, he receives a +1 morale bonus to AC against the target of his challenge so long as the cavalier is physically located between his ward and the target. This bonus increases by 1 for every 4 levels the cavalier possesses.<br><br><strong>Skills:</strong> An order of the guard cavalier adds Knowledge (geography) and Perception to his list of class skills. Additionally, an order of the guard cavalier receives a bonus on Knowledge (nobility) checks equal to 1/2 his cavalier level (minimum +1).</p>",
