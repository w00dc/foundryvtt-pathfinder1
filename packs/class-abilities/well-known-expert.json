      "value": "<p>The vigilante’s social identity is known as an expert in numerous fields, including areas and topics the vigilante hasn’t actually taken the time to study. As a result the vigilante is skilled at encouraging others to discover solutions to difficult problems themselves by asking probing questions, while appearing to give the information himself.<br><br>In his social identity, the vigilante can take 10 when attempting to aid another on Appraise, Craft, and Knowledge checks. He also gains a bonus equal to half his class level (minimum +1) on Bluff checks to appear knowledgeable in Appraise, Craft (all), and Knowledge (all). If he has the renownUI social talent, he grants a +3 bonus when he successfully aids another on these skill checks, rather than +2.<br><br>In his area of renown, the vigilante’s social identity is so trusted as an expert that scholars are inspired to make amazing deductions and intuitive leaps in discussions with him. A creature that has already failed a Knowledge check on a specific subject can attempt one additional check to gain information on the same topic if it receives an aid another bonus from the vigilante when doing so.</p>",
