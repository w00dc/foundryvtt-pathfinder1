      "value": "<p>An omdura can call forth he power of her deity to improve her allies’ abilities as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>.</p>\n<p>When the omdura calls upon this power, she must select one type of invocation from those listed below to grant the benefits to her allies within 30 feet. If the omdura is evil, she grants&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Profane-Bonus\">profane</a>&nbsp;bonuses instead of sacred, as appropriate. Neutral omduras must select&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Profane-Bonus\">profane</a>&nbsp;or sacred bonuses. Once made, this choice cannot be changed. A called invocation cannot be disrupted, but it ends immediately if the omdura is killed,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Paralyzed\">paralyzed</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Stunned\">stunned</a>, or knocked&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious\">unconscious</a>.</p>\n<p>The omdura can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. The omdura can change her chosen invocation to another type as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>, but doing so expends a 1-minute increment of her invocations.</p>\n<p>At 7th level, an omdura can call an invocation as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions\">move action</a>&nbsp;instead of a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>. At 13th level, an omdura can call an invocation as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Destruction: </strong>The omdura’s allies are filled with divine wrath, gaining a +1&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Sacred-Bonus\">sacred bonus</a>&nbsp;on weapon damage rolls. This bonus increases by 1 for every 3 class levels the omdura has.</li>\n<li><strong>Healing:</strong> The omdura radiates a healing light, granting&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Fast-Healing-Ex-\">fast healing</a>&nbsp;1. This causes the omdura’s allies to recover 1 hit point each round (up to their maximum&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points\">hit points</a>). The amount of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Fast-Healing-Ex-\">fast healing</a>&nbsp;increases by 1 for every 3 class levels the omdura has.</li>\n<li><strong>Justice:</strong> This invocation spurs the omdura’s allies to seek justice, granting a +1&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Sacred-Bonus\">sacred bonus</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack rolls</a>. This bonus increases by 1 for every 5 class levels the omdura has. At 10th level, this bonus is doubled on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack rolls</a>&nbsp;to confirm critical hits.</li>\n<li><strong>Piercing:</strong> This invocation gives the omdura’s allies great focus and makes their spells more potent. This benefit grants a +1&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Sacred-Bonus\">sacred bonus</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Concentration\">concentration</a>&nbsp;checks and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level\">caster level</a>&nbsp;checks to overcome a target’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Spell-Resistance\">spell resistance</a>. This bonus increases by 1 for every 3 class levels the omdura has.</li>\n<li><strong>Protection:</strong> The omdura radiates a protective aura, granting a +1&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Sacred-Bonus\">sacred bonus</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Armor-Class\">Armor Class</a>. This bonus increases by 1 for every 5 class levels the omdura has. At 10th level, this bonus is doubled against&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack rolls</a>&nbsp;to confirm critical hits against the omdura’s allies.</li>\n<li><strong>Purify: </strong>The omdura’s allies are protected from the vile taint of her foes, gaining a +1&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Sacred-Bonus\">sacred bonus</a>&nbsp;on all saving throws. This bonus increases by 1 for every 5 class levels the omdura has.

This&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Damage-Reduction-Ex-or-Su-\">DR</a>&nbsp;increases by 1 for every 5 class levels the omdura has. At 10th level, this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Damage-Reduction-Ex-or-Su-\">DR</a>&nbsp;changes from magic to an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment\">alignment</a>&nbsp;(chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) that is opposite the omdura’s. If she is neutral, the type of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Damage-Reduction-Ex-or-Su-\">DR</a>&nbsp;doesn’t change.</li>\n<li><strong>Resistance:</strong> The omdura’s allies are shielded by a flickering aura, gaining 2 points of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Energy-Resistance\">energy resistance</a>&nbsp;against one energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic)chosen when the omdura calls this invocation. The protection increases by 2 for every 3 class levels the omdura has.</li>\n<li><strong>Smiting:</strong> This invocation bathes the weapons of the omdura’s allies in a divine light. These weapons count as magic for the purpose of bypassing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction\">damage reduction</a>. At 6th level, the allies’ weapons also count as one alignment type (chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) for the purpose of bypassing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction\">damage reduction</a>. The type selected must match one of the omdura’s alignments. If the omdura is neutral, she does not grant this bonus. At 10th level, the allies’ weapons also count as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials#TOC-Adamantine\">adamantine</a>&nbsp;for the purpose of overcoming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction\">damage reduction</a>&nbsp;(but not for reducing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/damaging-objects#TOC-Hardness\">hardness</a>).</li>\n</ul>",
