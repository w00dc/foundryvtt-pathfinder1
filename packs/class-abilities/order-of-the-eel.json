      "value": "<p>Cavaliers who join the order of the eel believe communication and negotiation are the true paths to greatness and success for all. They seek out new individuals to befriend, offer their services as guides or mercenaries, and negotiate the terms of mutually beneficial arrangements. Locathah eel riders were the founders of the order of the eel, but other aquatic races have since joined. Even a few land-dwelling cavaliers along the coastline have pledged themselves to this order of diplomats and negotiators.<br><br><strong>Edicts: </strong>The cavalier must greet all strangers with an open mind and show a willingness to cooperate with others. The cavalier must never turn down the opportunity to forge alliances or strike bargains, so long as the terms of such agreements remain fair. The cavalier must punish those who have reneged on bargains struck with the cavalier or others of his order.<br><br><strong>Challenge:</strong> Whenever an order of the eel cavalier issues a challenge, allies of a different race than the cavalier receive a +1 circumstance bonus on attack rolls against the target of his challenge whenever he is threatening the target. This bonus increases by +1 for every 4 levels the cavalier has.<br><br><strong>Skills:</strong> An order of the eel cavalier adds Knowledge (local) (Int) and Perception (Wis) to his list of class skills. An order of the eel cavalier can attempt Knowledge (local) skill checks untrained. In addition, whenever an order of the eel cavalier uses Diplomacy to negotiate the terms of an agreement, he receives a bonus on the check equal to half his cavalier level (minimum +1).</p>",
