      "value": "<p>At 4th level, a ranger forms a bond with his hunting companions. This bond can take one of two forms. Once the form is chosen, it cannot be changed. The first is a bond to his companions. This bond allows him to spend a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions\">move action</a>&nbsp;to grant half his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/Ranger/#TOC-Favored-Enemy-Ex-\">favored enemy</a>&nbsp;bonus against a single target of the appropriate type to all allies within 30 feet who can see or hear him. This bonus lasts for a number of rounds equal to the ranger’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;modifier (minimum 1). This bonus does not stack with any&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/Ranger/#TOC-Favored-Enemy-Ex-\">favored enemy</a>&nbsp;bonuses possessed by his allies; they use whichever bonus is higher.</p>\n<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions\">animal companion</a>. A ranger who selects an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions\">animal companion</a>&nbsp;can choose from the following list:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Badger\">badger</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Bird\">bird</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-camel\">camel</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Cat-Small\">cat (small)</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Rat-Dire\">dire rat</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Dog\">dog</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Horse\">horse</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Pony\">pony</a>, snake (<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Snake-Viper\">viper</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Snake-Constrictor\">constrictor</a>), or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Wolf\">wolf</a>. If the campaign takes place wholly or partly in an aquatic environment, the ranger may choose a shark instead. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the ranger on his adventures as appropriate for its kind.
