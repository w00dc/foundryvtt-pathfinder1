      "value": "<p>Within the purity of the elements and the order of the wilds lingers a power beyond the marvels of civilization. Furtive yet undeniable, these primal magics are guarded over by servants of philosophical balance known as druids. Allies to beasts and manipulators of nature, these often misunderstood protectors of the wild strive to shield their lands from all who would threaten them and prove the might of the wilds to those who lock themselves behind city walls. Rewarded for their devotion with incredible powers, druids gain unparalleled shape-shifting abilities, the companionship of mighty beasts, and the power to call upon nature’s wrath. The mightiest temper powers akin to storms, earthquakes, and volcanoes with primeval wisdom long abandoned and forgotten by civilization.</p>\n<p><strong>Role</strong>: While some druids might keep to the fringe of battle, allowing companions and summoned creatures to fight while they confound foes with the powers of nature, others transform into deadly beasts and savagely wade into combat. Druids worship personifications of elemental forces, natural powers, or nature itself. Typically this means devotion to a nature deity, though druids are just as likely to revere vague spirits, animalistic demigods, or even specific awe-inspiring natural wonders.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment</strong>: Any neutral</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d8</p>\n<p><strong>Starting Wealth</strong>: 2d6 × 10 gp (average 70 gp.)

      "value": "<h2>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</h2>\n<p>Druids are proficient with the following weapons: club, dagger, dart, quarterstaff, scimitar, scythe, sickle, shortspear, sling, and spear. They are also proficient with all natural attacks (claw, bite, and so forth) of any form they assume with wild shape (see below).</p>\n<p>Druids are proficient with light and medium armor but are prohibited from wearing metal armor; thus, they may wear only padded, leather, or hide armor. A druid may also wear wooden armor that has been altered by the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/i/ironwood\">ironwood</a>&nbsp;spell so that it functions as though it were steel. Druids are proficient with shields (except tower shields) but must use only wooden ones.</p>\n<p>A druid who wears prohibited armor or uses a prohibited shield is unable to cast druid spells or use any of her supernatural or spell-like class abilities while doing so and for 24 hours thereafter.</p>\n<h2>Spells</h2>\n<p>A druid casts divine spells, which are drawn from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/spell-lists-and-domains/spell-lists-druid\">druid spell list</a>. Her alignment may restrict her from casting certain spells opposed to her moral or ethical beliefs; see Chaotic, Evil, Good, and Lawful Spells. A druid must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>\n<p>To prepare or cast a spell, the druid must have a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw against a druid’s spell is 10 + the spell level + the druid’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;modifier.</p>\n<p>Like other spellcasters, a druid can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on&nbsp;Table: Druid. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;score (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Abilities-and-Spellcasters\" rel=\"nofollow\">Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells</a>).</p>\n<p>A druid must spend 1 hour each day in a trance-like meditation on the mysteries of nature to regain her daily allotment of spells. A druid may prepare and cast any spell on the druid spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily meditation.</p>\n<h2>Spontaneous Casting</h2>\n<p>A druid can channel stored spell energy into summoning spells that she hasn’t prepared ahead of time. She can “lose” a prepared spell in order to cast any&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/summon-natures-ally\">summon nature’s ally</a>&nbsp;spell of the same level or lower.</p>\n<h2>Chaotic, Evil, Good and Lawful Spells</h2>\n<p>A druid can’t cast spells of an alignment opposed to her own or her deity’s (if she has one). Spells associated with particular alignments are indicated by the chaos, evil, good, and law descriptors in their spell descriptions.</p>\n<h2>Orisons (Sp)</h2>\n<p>Druids can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day, as noted on&nbsp;Table: Druid&nbsp;under “Spells per Day.” These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>\n<h2>Bonus Languages</h2>\n<p>A druid’s bonus language options include Sylvan, the language of woodland creatures. This choice is in addition to the bonus languages available to the character because of her race.</p>\n<p>A druid also knows Druidic, a secret language known only to druids, which she learns upon becoming a 1st-level druid. Druidic is a free language for a druid; that is, she knows it in addition to her regular allotment of languages and it doesn’t take up a language slot. Druids are forbidden to teach this language to nondruids.</p>\n<p>Druidic has its own alphabet.</p>\n<h2>Nature Bond (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, a druid forms a bond with nature. This bond can take one of two forms. The first is a close tie to the natural world, granting the druid one of the following cleric domains:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/air-domain\" rel=\"nofollow\">Air</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/animal-domain\" rel=\"nofollow\">Animal</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/earth-domain\" rel=\"nofollow\">Earth</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/fire-domain\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fire</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/plant-domain\" rel=\"nofollow\">Plant</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/water-domain\" rel=\"nofollow\">Water</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/cleric/domains/paizo-domains/weather-domain\" rel=\"nofollow\">Weather</a>. Druids also have access to a set of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/archetypes/paizo-druid-archetypes/animal-and-terrain-domains\">Animal and Terrain Domains</a>. When determining the powers and bonus spells granted by this domain, the druid’s effective cleric level is equal to her druid level. A druid that selects this option also receives additional domain spell slots, just like a cleric. She must prepare the spell from her domain in this slot and this spell cannot be used to cast a spell spontaneously.</p>\n<p>The second option is to form a close bond with an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions\">animal companion</a>. A druid may begin play with any of the animals listed in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/druid/animal-companions#TOC-Animal-Choices\">Animal Choices</a>. This animal is a loyal companion that accompanies the druid on her adventures.</p>\n<p>Unlike normal animals of its kind, an animal companion’s Hit Dice, abilities, skills, and feats advance as the druid advances in level. If a character receives an animal companion from more than one source, her effective druid levels stack for the purposes of determining the statistics and abilities of the companion. Most animal companions increase in size when their druid reaches 4th or 7th level, depending on the companion. If a druid releases her companion from service, she may gain a new one by performing a ceremony requiring 24 uninterrupted hours of prayer in the environment where the new companion typically lives. This ceremony can also replace an animal companion that has perished.</p>\n<h2>Nature Sense (Ex)</h2>\n<p>A druid gains a +2 bonus on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge\">Knowledge</a>&nbsp;(nature) and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival\">Survival</a>&nbsp;checks.</p>\n<h2>Wild Empathy (Ex)</h2>\n<p>A druid can improve the attitude of an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>. This ability functions just like a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/diplomacy\">Diplomacy</a>&nbsp;check made to improve the attitude of a person. The druid rolls 1d20 and adds her druid level and her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;modifier to determine the wild empathy check result.</p>\n<p>The typical domestic&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>&nbsp;has a starting attitude of indifferent, while wild&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animals</a>&nbsp;are usually unfriendly.</p>\n<p>To use wild empathy, the druid and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>&nbsp;must be able to study each other, which means that they must be within 30 feet of one another under normal conditions. Generally, influencing an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>&nbsp;in this way takes 1 minute but, as with influencing people, it might take more or less time.</p>\n<p>A druid can also use this ability to influence a magical beast with an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;score of 1 or 2, but she takes a –4 penalty on the check.</p>\n<h2>Woodland Stride (Ex)</h2>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, a druid may move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at her normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect her.</p>\n<h2>Trackless Step (Ex)</h2>\n<p>Starting at 3rd level, a druid leaves no trail in natural surroundings and cannot be tracked. She may choose to leave a trail if so desired.</p>\n<h2>Resist Nature's Lure (Ex)</h2>\n<p>Starting at 4th level, a druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like and supernatural abilities of fey. This bonus also applies to spells and effects that target plants, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/blight\">blight</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/entangle\">entangle</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/spike-growth\">spike growth</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/w/warp-wood\">warp wood</a>.</p>\n<h2>Wild Shape (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 4th level, a druid gains the ability to turn herself into any small or Medium&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>&nbsp;and back again once per day. Her options for new forms include all creatures with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>&nbsp;type. This ability functions like the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/beast-shape\">beast shape I</a>&nbsp;spell, except as noted here. The effect lasts for 1 hour per druid level, or until she changes back. Changing form (to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>&nbsp;or back) is a standard action and doesn’t provoke an attack of opportunity. The form chosen must be that of an animal the druid is familiar with.</p>\n<p>A druid loses her ability to speak while in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>&nbsp;form because she is limited to the sounds that a normal, untrained animal can make, but she can communicate normally with other animals of the same general grouping as her new form. (The normal sound a wild parrot makes is a squawk, so changing to this form does not permit speech.)</p>\n<p>A druid can use this ability an additional time per day at 6th level and every two levels thereafter, for a total of eight times at 18th level. At 20th level, a druid can use wild shape at will. As a druid gains in levels, this ability allows the druid to take on the form of larger and smaller animals,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/outsiders/elemental\">elementals</a>, and plants.
