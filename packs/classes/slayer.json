He cannot use a weapon that deals lethal damage to deal nonlethal damage in a sneak attack, not even with the usual –4 penalty.</p>\n<p>The slayer must be able to see the target well enough to pick out a vital spot and must be able to reach such a spot.

When moving at up to twice his normal speed while tracking, he takes only a –10 penalty instead of the normal –20.</p>\n<h2>Slayer's Advance (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 13th level, a slayer can once per day move up to twice his base&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Speed\">speed</a>&nbsp;as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions\">move action</a>. He may use&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/stealth\">Stealth</a>&nbsp;as part of this movement, but takes a –10 penalty to his check for doing so. At 17th level, he can do this twice per day.</p>\n<h2>Quarry (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 14th level, a slayer can as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>&nbsp;denote one target within his line of sight as his quarry.

In addition, he gains a +2&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Insight-Bonus\">insight bonus</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack rolls</a>&nbsp;made against his quarry, and all&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits\">critical threats</a>&nbsp;against his quarry are automatically confirmed. A slayer can have no more than one quarry at a time, and the target must be selected as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/SLAYER/#TOC-Studied-Target-Ex-\">studied target</a>. He can dismiss this effect at any time as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>, but he cannot select a new quarry target for 24 hours. If the slayer sees proof that his quarry is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead\">dead</a>, he can select a new quarry target after 1 hour.</p>\n<h2>Improved Quarry (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 19th level, the slayer’s ability to hunt his quarry improves. He can now select a quarry as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>, and can now&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Take-20\">take 20</a>&nbsp;while using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival\">Survival</a>&nbsp;to track his quarry, while moving at normal&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Speed\">speed</a>&nbsp;without penalty.
