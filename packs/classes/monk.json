These warrior-artists search out methods of battle beyond swords and shields, finding weapons within themselves just as capable of crippling or killing as any blade. These monks (so called since they adhere to ancient philosophies and strict martial disciplines) elevate their bodies to become weapons of war, from battle-minded ascetics to self-taught brawlers. Monks tread the path of discipline, and those with the will to endure that path discover within themselves not what they are, but what they are meant to be.</p>\n<p><strong>Role</strong>: Monks excel at overcoming even the most daunting perils, striking where it’s least expected, and taking advantage of enemy vulnerabilities. Fleet of foot and skilled in combat, monks can navigate any battlefield with ease, aiding allies wherever they are needed most.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment</strong>: Any lawful</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d8</p>\n<p><strong>Starting Wealth</strong>: 1d6 × 10 gp (average 35 gp.)

A monk’s attacks may be with fist, elbows, knees, and feet. This means that a monk may make unarmed strikes with his hands full. There is no such thing as an off-hand attack for a monk striking unarmed. A monk may thus apply his full&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-\">Strength</a>&nbsp;bonus on damage rolls for all his unarmed strikes.</p>\n<p>Usually a monk’s unarmed strikes deal lethal damage, but he can choose to deal&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage\">nonlethal damage</a>&nbsp;instead with no penalty on his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack roll</a>. He has the same choice to deal lethal or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage\">nonlethal damage</a>&nbsp;while&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple\">grappling</a>.</p>\n<p>A monk’s unarmed strike is treated as both a manufactured weapon and a natural weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured weapons or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks\">natural weapons</a>.</p>\n<p>A monk also deals more damage with his unarmed strikes than a normal person would, as shown above on&nbsp;Table: Monk.

A monk in armor or carrying a medium or heavy load loses this extra speed.</p>\n<h2>Maneuver Training (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 3rd level, a monk uses his monk level in place of his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Bonus\">base attack bonus</a>&nbsp;when calculating his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Bonus\">Combat Maneuver Bonus</a>.

As long as he has at least 1 point in his&nbsp;ki&nbsp;pool, he can make a&nbsp;ki&nbsp;strike.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>At 4th level,&nbsp;ki&nbsp;strike allows his unarmed attacks to be treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction\">damage reduction</a>.</li>\n<li>At 7th level,&nbsp;his unarmed attacks are also treated as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials#TOC-Iron-Cold\">cold iron</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials#TOC-Silver-Alchemical\">silver</a>&nbsp;for the purpose of overcoming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction\">damage reduction</a>.</li>\n<li>At 10th level, his unarmed attacks are also treated as lawful weapons for the purpose of overcoming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction\">damage reduction</a>.</li>\n<li>At 16th level, his unarmed attacks are treated as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials#TOC-Adamantine\">adamantine</a>&nbsp;weapons for the purpose of overcoming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction\">damage reduction</a>&nbsp;and bypassing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/damaging-objects#TOC-Hardness\">hardness</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By spending 1 point from his&nbsp;ki&nbsp;pool, a monk can do one of the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Make one additional attack at his highest&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Bonus\">attack bonus</a>&nbsp;when making a flurry of blows attack, or</li>\n<li>Increase his speed by 20 feet for 1 round, or</li>\n<li>Give himself a +4&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Dodge-Bonuses\">dodge bonus</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Armor-Class\">AC</a>&nbsp;for 1 round.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Each of these powers is activated as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>.</p>\n<p>The&nbsp;ki&nbsp;pool is replenished each morning after 8 hours of rest or meditation; these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>\n<h2>Slow Fall (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 4th level or higher, a monk within arm’s reach of a wall can use it to slow his descent. When first gaining this ability, he takes damage as if the fall were 20 feet shorter than it actually is. The monk’s ability to slow his fall (that is, to reduce the effective distance of the fall when next to a wall) improves with his monk level until at 20th level he can use a nearby wall to slow his descent and fall any distance without harm.</p>\n<h2>High Jump (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 5th level, a monk adds his level to all&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/acrobatics\">Acrobatics</a>&nbsp;checks made to jump, both for vertical jumps and horizontal jumps. In addition, he always counts as having a running start when making jump checks using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/acrobatics\">Acrobatics</a>. By spending 1 point from his&nbsp;ki&nbsp;pool as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>, a monk gains a +20 bonus on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/acrobatics\">Acrobatics</a>&nbsp;checks made to jump for 1 round.</p>\n<h2>Purity of Body (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 5th level, a monk gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Immunity-Ex-or-Su-\">immunity</a>&nbsp;to all diseases, including&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Supernatural-Abilities-Su-\">supernatural</a>&nbsp;and magical diseases.</p>\n<h2>Wholeness of Body (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 7th level or higher, a monk can heal his own wounds as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>. He can heal a number of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Hit-Points\">hit points</a>&nbsp;of damage equal to his monk level by using 2 points from his&nbsp;ki&nbsp;pool.</p>\n<h2>Improved Evasion (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 9th level, a monk’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Evasion-Ex-\">evasion</a>&nbsp;ability improves. He still takes no damage on a successful&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex\">Reflex</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws\">saving throw</a>&nbsp;against attacks, but henceforth he takes only half damage on a failed save. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Helpless\">helpless</a>&nbsp;monk does not gain the benefit of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Improved-Evasion-Ex-\">improved evasion</a>.</p>\n<h2>Diamond Body (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 11th level, a monk gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Immunity-Ex-or-Su-\">immunity</a>&nbsp;to poisons of all kinds.</p>\n<h2>Abundant Step (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 12th level or higher, a monk can slip magically between spaces, as if using the spell&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/d/dimension-door\">dimension door</a>. Using this ability is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions\">move action</a>&nbsp;that consumes 2 points from his&nbsp;ki&nbsp;pool. His&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level\">caster level</a>&nbsp;for this effect is equal to his monk level. He cannot take other creatures with him when he uses this ability.</p>\n<h2>Diamond Soul (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 13th level, a monk gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Spell-Resistance\">spell resistance</a>&nbsp;equal to his current monk level + 10. In order to affect the monk with a spell, a spellcaster must get a result on a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level\">caster level</a>&nbsp;check (1d20 +&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level\">caster level</a>) that equals or exceeds the monk’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Spell-Resistance\">spell resistance</a>.</p>\n<h2>Quivering Palm (Su)</h2>\n<p>Starting at 15th level, a monk can set up vibrations within the body of another creature that can thereafter be fatal if the monk so desires. He can use this quivering palm attack once per day, and he must announce his intent before making his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack roll</a>. Creatures immune to critical hits cannot be affected. Otherwise, if the monk strikes successfully and the target takes damage from the blow, the quivering palm attack succeeds. Thereafter, the monk can try to slay the victim at any later time, as long as the attempt is made within a number of days equal to his monk level. To make such an attempt, the monk merely wills the target to die (a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Free-Actions\">free action</a>), and unless the target makes a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude\">Fortitude</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws\">saving throw</a>&nbsp;(DC 10 + 1/2 the monk’s level + the monk’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wis</a>&nbsp;modifier), it dies. If the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Saving-Throws\">saving throw</a>&nbsp;is successful, the target is no longer in danger from that particular quivering palm attack, but it may still be affected by another one at a later time. A monk can have no more than 1 quivering palm in effect at one time. If a monk uses quivering palm while another is still in effect, the previous effect is negated.</p>\n<h2>Timeless Body (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 17th level, a monk no longer takes penalties to his ability scores for aging and cannot be magically aged. Any such penalties that he has already taken, however, remain in place. Age bonuses still accrue, and the monk still dies of old age when his time is up.</p>\n<h2>Tongue of the Sun and Moon (Ex)</h2>\n<p>A monk of 17th level or higher can speak with any living creature.</p>\n<h2>Empty Body (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 19th level, a monk gains the ability to assume an ethereal state for 1 minute as though using the spell&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/e/etherealness\">etherealness</a>. Using this ability is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions\">move action</a>&nbsp;that consumes 3 points from his&nbsp;ki&nbsp;pool. This ability only affects the monk and cannot be used to make other creatures ethereal.</p>\n<h2>Perfect Self</h2>\n<p>At 20th level, a monk becomes a magical creature. He is forevermore treated as an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider\">outsider</a>&nbsp;rather than as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Humanoid\">humanoid</a>&nbsp;(or whatever the monk’s creature type was) for the purpose of spells and magical effects. Additionally, the monk gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction-DR-\">damage reduction</a>&nbsp;10/<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Chaotic\">chaotic</a>, which allows him to ignore the first 10 points of damage from any attack made by a nonchaotic weapon or by any&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks\">natural attack</a>&nbsp;made by a creature that doesn’t have similar&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction\">damage reduction</a>. Unlike other&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider\">outsiders</a>, the monk can still be brought back from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Dead\">dead</a>&nbsp;as if he were a member of his previous creature type.</p>",
