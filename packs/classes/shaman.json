They form powerful bonds with particular spirits, and as their power grows they learn to call upon other spirits in times of need.</p>\n<p><strong>Role</strong>: Shamans make for potent divine spellcasters, capable of using divine spells and the power of their spirits to aid their allies and destroy their foes.

      "value": "<h2>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</h2>\n<p>A shaman is proficient with all simple weapons, and with light and medium armor.</p>\n<h2>Spell Casting</h2>\n<p>A shaman casts divine spells drawn from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/spell-lists-and-domains/shaman\">shaman spell list</a>. A shaman must choose and prepare her spells in advance.</p>\n<p>To prepare or cast a spell, a shaman must have a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;score equal to at least 10 + the spell’s level. The saving throw DC against a shaman’s spell is 10 + the spell’s level + the shaman’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;modifier.</p>\n<p>Like other spellcasters, a shaman can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on&nbsp;Table: Shaman. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;score.</p>\n<p>Shamans commune with their spirit animals to prepare their spells. Each shaman must choose a time when she must spend 1 hour each day in quiet contemplation with her spirit&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Animal\">animal</a>&nbsp;to regain her daily allotment of spells. A shaman can prepare and cast any spell on the shaman spell list, provided that she can cast spells of that level, but she must choose which spells to prepare during her daily communion.</p>\n<h2>Orisons</h2>\n<p>Shamans can prepare a number of orisons, or 0-level spells, each day as noted on&nbsp;Table: Shaman. These spells are cast like any other spell, but they are not expended when cast and may be used again.</p>\n<h2>Spirit (Su)</h2>\n<p>A shaman forms a mystical bond with the spirits of the world. She forms a lasting bond with a single spirit, which grants a number of abilities and defines many of her other class features.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, a shaman gains the spirit ability granted by her chosen spirit. She adds the spells granted by that spirit to the list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She also adds the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/witch#TOC-Hex\">hexes</a>&nbsp;possessed by that spirit to the list of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/witch#TOC-Hex\">hexes</a>&nbsp;that she can use with the hex and wandering hex class features.</p>\n<p>At 8th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her selected spirit. At 16th level, the shaman gains the abilities listed for the true version of her selected spirit.</p>\n<p>If the shaman takes levels in another class that grants a mystery (such as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/oracle\">oracle</a>), the spirit and mystery must match, even if that means one of them must change. Subject to GM discretion, the shaman can change her former mystery or spirit to make them conform.</p>\n<h2>Spirit Animal (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 1st level, a shaman forms a close bond with a spirit animal tied to her chosen spirit. This animal is her conduit to the spirit world, guiding her along the path to enlightenment. The animal also aids a shaman by granting her a special ability. A shaman must commune with her spirit animal each day to prepare her spells. While the spirit animal does not store the spells like a witch’s familiar does, the spirit animal serves as her conduit to divine power. If a shaman’s spirit animal is slain, she cannot prepare new spells or use her spirit magic class feature until the spirit animal is replaced.</p>\n<p>At 1st level, a shaman’s spirit animal gains specific abilities, depending upon the type of spirit selected by the shaman using her spirit class feature. These abilities affect the animal’s appearance and grant it special abilities that can aid it in serving the shaman and the spirit it represents and is connected to. These abilities are described in the spirit animal section of each individual spirit description.</p>\n<p><a name=\"TOC-Deliver-Touch-Spells-Su-\"></a><strong>Deliver Touch Spells (Su)</strong>: If a shaman is 3rd level or higher, her spirit animal can deliver&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks\">touch</a>&nbsp;spells or hexes for her. If the shaman and the spirit animal are in contact at the time the shaman casts a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks\">touch</a>&nbsp;spell, she can designate her animal as the “toucher.” The spirit animal can then deliver the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks\">touch</a>&nbsp;spell just as the shaman would. If the shaman casts another spell before the touch is delivered, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks\">touch</a>&nbsp;spell dissipates. If the shaman activates a hex, her spirit animal can be used to make the touch; she doesn’t have to be in contact with the animal to use this ability with hexes.</p>\n<h2>Spirit Magic</h2>\n<p>A shaman can spontaneously cast a limited number of spells per day beyond those she prepared ahead of time. She has one spell slot per day of each shaman spell level she can cast, not including orisons. She can choose these spells from the list of spells granted by her spirits (see the spirit class feature and the wandering spirit class feature) at the time she casts them. She can enhance these spells using any&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/metamagic-feats\">metamagic feat</a>&nbsp;that she knows, using up a higher-level spell slot as required by the feat and increasing the time to cast the spell (see Spontaneous Casting and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/metamagic-feats\">Metamagic Feats</a>).</p>\n<h2>Hex</h2>\n<p>A shaman learns a number of magical tricks, called hexes, which grant her powers or weaken foes. At 2nd level, a shaman learns one hex. At 4th, 8th, 10th, 12th, 16th, 18th, and 20th level, the shaman learns new hexes. A shaman can select from any of the following hexes or from any of the hexes listed in the description of her chosen spirit. A shaman cannot select a hex more than once unless noted otherwise.</p>\n<p>Using a hex is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>&nbsp;that doesn’t provoke an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity\">attack of opportunity</a>&nbsp;unless otherwise noted. The saving throw DC to resist a hex is equal to 10 + 1/2 the shaman’s level + the shaman’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;modifier.</p>\n<div>\n<p><strong>Chant (Su)</strong>: A shaman can chant as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions\">move action</a>.

The effect lasts for a number of rounds equal to the shaman’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;modifier (minimum 1).

Whether or not the save is successful, the creature cannot be the target of this hex again for 24 hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Secret (Ex)</strong>: The shaman receives one&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/metamagic-feats\">metamagic feat</a>&nbsp;as a bonus feat. The shaman must meet the prerequisites for the feat.</p>\n<p><strong>Shapeshift (Su)</strong>: The shaman transforms herself into another form for a number of minutes per day equal to her level, as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/alter-self\">alter self</a>. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but must be spent in 1-minute increments. Changing form (including changing back) is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>&nbsp;that doesn’t provoke an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity\">attack of opportunity</a>. At 8th level, this ability works as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/beast-shape\">beast shape I</a>. At 12th level, this ability works as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/beast-shape\">beast shape II</a>. At 16th level, this ability works as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/beast-shape\">beast shape III</a>. At 20th level, this ability works as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/b/beast-shape\">beast shape IV</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Silkstring Snare (Su)</strong>: The shaman causes ribbons of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/monster-listings/vermin/spider\">spider</a>&nbsp;silk to erupt from the ground beneath a single creature. The target must succeed at a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex\">Reflex</a>&nbsp;save or be&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Entangled\">entangled</a>&nbsp;and anchored in place. The foe can escape the silk as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>&nbsp;with a successful&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/escape-artist\">Escape Artist</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-\">Strength</a>&nbsp;check at the same DC, or by dealing an amount of damage to the silk equal to double the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/shaman\">shaman’s</a>&nbsp;class level (the silk has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/damaging-objects#TOC-Hardness\">hardness</a>&nbsp;0). This hex lasts a number of rounds equal to 3 + the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/shaman\">shaman’s</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;modifier. A creature affected by this hex cannot be affected by it again for 24 hours.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://amzn.to/2DC0iFw\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PZO9480</a></p>\n<p><strong>Tongues (Su)</strong>: The shaman understands any spoken language for a number of minutes per day equal to her level, as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/c/comprehend-languages\">comprehend languages</a>. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. At 5th level, a shaman can use this ability to speak any language, as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/t/tongues\">tongues</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Ward (Su)</strong>: The shaman places a protective ward over one creature. The warded creature receives a +2&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Deflection-Bonus\">deflection bonus</a>&nbsp;to AC and a +2&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Resistance-Bonus\">resistance bonus</a>&nbsp;on saving throws. This effect lasts until the warded creature is hit or fails a saving throw. A shaman knows when a warded creature is no longer protected. A shaman can have only one ward active at a time. If the shaman uses this hex while a previous ward is still active, that previous ward immediately ends. A shaman cannot use this ability on herself. At 8th and 16th levels, the bonuses provided by this ward increase by 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Wings (Su)</strong>: The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/shaman\">shaman</a>&nbsp;can grow a pair of wings for a number of minutes per day equal to her level. These minutes do not need to be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-minute increments. Initially, these wings lack the power to allow the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/shaman\">shaman</a>&nbsp;to fly, but the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/shaman\">shaman</a>&nbsp;can use them as a secondary&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks\">natural attack</a>&nbsp;that deals 1d3 points of damage (1d2 for a Small&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/shaman\">shaman</a>). At 3rd level, she can use the wings to safely descend any&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/magic-weapons/magic-weapon-special-abilities/distance\">distance</a>, as if using the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/f/feather-fall\">feather fall</a>&nbsp;spell. At 7th level, she can use the wings to fly with poor maneuverability and a fly speed of 30 feet, but the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/shaman\">shaman</a>&nbsp;must land at the end of each turn or fall. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/shaman\">shaman</a>&nbsp;of 8th level or higher can select the wings hex a second time. This doubles the number of minutes per day the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/hybrid-classes/shaman\">shaman</a>&nbsp;can use her wings (2 minutes per level), and allows her to fly with average maneuverability and a fly speed of 30 feet while the wings are active.&nbsp;Source&nbsp;<a href=\"https://amzn.to/2PgFB7S\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">PPC:HftF</a></p>\n<p><strong>Witch Hex</strong>: The shaman selects any one hex normally available through the witch’s hex class feature. She treats her shaman level as her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/witch\">witch</a>&nbsp;level when determining the powers and abilities of the hex. She uses her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\">Wisdom</a>&nbsp;modifier in place of her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;modifier for the hex. She cannot select major hexes or grand hexes using this ability. The shaman cannot select a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/witch\">witch</a>&nbsp;hex that has the same name as a shaman hex.</p>\n<h2>Wandering Spirit (Su)</h2>\n<p>At 4th level, a shaman can form a temporary bond with a spirit other than the one selected using her spirit class feature. She must make this selection each day when preparing her spells. While this feature is active, she gains the spirit ability granted by the spirit. She also adds the spells granted by that spirit to her list of spells that she can cast using spirit magic. She does not add the hexes from her wandering spirit to her list of hexes that she can choose from with the hex class feature. At 12th level, she gains the abilities listed in the greater version of her wandering spirit. At 20th level, she gains the ability listed in the true version of her wandering spirit.</p>\n<h2>Wandering Hex</h2>\n<p>At 6th level, a shaman can temporarily gain the use of one of the hexes possessed by either one of her spirits. She must make this selection each day when she prepares her spells. For the purposes of this ability, she can select any hex possessed by her spirit or wandering spirit. If she selects it from her wandering spirit, she loses the hex immediately if she bonds with another spirit, although she can then select a different hex to gain using this ability, from either her spirit or her new wandering spirit. At 14th level, a shaman can select two wandering hexes each day instead of one. This ability otherwise functions as the hex class feature.</p>\n<h2>Manifestation (Su)</h2>\n<p>Upon reaching 20th level, a shaman undergoes a transformation as she manifests as a pinnacle of her main spirit. The nature of this manifestation depends on the shaman’s spirit, and is described in its entry.</p>\n</div>",
