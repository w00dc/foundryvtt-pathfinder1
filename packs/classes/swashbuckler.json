      "value": "<p>Whereas many warriors brave battle encased in suits of armor and wielding large and powerful weapons, swashbucklers rely on speed, agility, and panache. Swashbucklers dart in and out of the fray, wearing down opponents with lunges and feints, all while foiling the powerful attacks against them with a flick of the wrist and a flash of the blade. Their deft parries and fatal ripostes are carnage elevated to an art form. Some may be arrogant and devil-may-care, but behind this veneer lie people deeply dedicated to their craft. Those of smaller races are particularly driven to prove that the right mix of discipline and daring is the perfect counter to size and strength, and enjoy nothing more than taking down lumbering brutes and bullies.</p>\n<p><strong>Role</strong>: Combining fancy footwork with quick and precise lunges, swashbucklers dart in and out of battle, harassing and thwarting their opponents. These fast and agile combatants serve as protectors for spellcasters and flank mates for rogues and slayers, while waiting for the opportunity to show panache and score the killing blow on some lumbering hulk. Swashbucklers often face death with wry humor, mocking it with jabbing wit.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment</strong>: Any.</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Die</strong>: d10.</p>\n<p><strong>Parent Classes</strong>:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter\">Fighter</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/base-classes/gunslinger\">gunslinger</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Starting Wealth</strong>: 5d6 × 10 gp (average 175 gp.)

She fights with panache: a fluctuating measure of a swashbuckler’s ability to perform amazing actions in combat. At the start of each day, a swashbuckler gains a number of panache points equal to her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;modifier (minimum 1). Her panache goes up or down throughout the day, but usually cannot go higher than her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;modifier (minimum 1), though feats and magic items can affect this maximum. A swashbuckler spends panache to accomplish deeds (see below), and regains panache in the following ways.</p>\n<div>\n<p><strong>Critical Hit with a Light or One-Handed Piercing Melee Weapon</strong>: Each time the swashbuckler confirms a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits\">critical hit</a>&nbsp;with a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon, she regains 1 panache point.

Most deeds grant the swashbuckler a momentary bonus or effect, but some provide longer-lasting effects. Some deeds remain in effect while the swashbuckler has at least 1 panache point, but do not require expending panache to be maintained. A swashbuckler can only perform deeds of her level or lower. Unless otherwise noted, a deed can be performed multiple successive times, as long as the swashbuckler has or spends the required number of panache points to perform the deed.</p>\n<div>\n<p><strong>Derring-Do (Ex)</strong>: At 1st level, a swashbuckler can spend 1 panache point when she makes an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/acrobatics\">Acrobatics</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/climb\">Climb</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/escape-artist\">Escape Artist</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/fly\">Fly</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/ride\">Ride</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/swim\">Swim</a>&nbsp;check to roll 1d6 and add the result to the check. She can do this after she makes the check but before the result is revealed. If the result of the d6 roll is a natural 6, she rolls another 1d6 and adds it to the check. She can continue to do this as long as she rolls natural 6s, up to a number of times equal to her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a>&nbsp;modifier (minimum 1).</p>\n<p><strong>Dodging Panache (Ex)</strong>: At 1st level, when an opponent attempts a melee attack against the swashbuckler, the swashbuckler can as an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Immediate-Actions\">immediate action</a>&nbsp;spend 1 panache point to move 5 feet; doing so grants the swashbuckler a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Dodge-Bonus\">dodge bonus</a>&nbsp;to AC equal to her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma</a>&nbsp;modifier (minimum 0) against the triggering attack. This movement doesn’t negate the attack, which is still resolved as if the swashbuckler had not moved from the original square. This movement is not a 5-foot step; it provokes&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity\">attacks of opportunity</a>&nbsp;from creatures other than the one who triggered this deed. The swashbuckler can only perform this deed while wearing light or no&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, and while carrying no heavier than a light load.</p>\n<p><strong>Opportune Parry and Riposte (Ex)</strong>: At 1st level, when an opponent makes a melee attack against the swashbuckler, she can spend 1 panache point and expend a use of an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity\">attack of opportunity</a>&nbsp;to attempt to parry that attack. The swashbuckler makes an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack roll</a>&nbsp;as if she were making an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity\">attack of opportunity</a>; for each size category the attacking creature is larger than the swashbuckler, the swashbuckler takes a –2 penalty on this roll. If her result is greater than the attacking creature’s result, the creature’s attack automatically misses. The swashbuckler must declare the use of this ability after the creature’s attack is announced, but before its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack roll</a>&nbsp;is made. Upon performing a successful parry and if she has at least 1 panache point, the swashbuckler can as an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Immediate-Actions\">immediate action</a>&nbsp;make an attack against the creature whose attack she parried, provided that creature is within her reach. This deed’s cost cannot be reduced by any ability or effect that reduces the number of panache points a deed costs.</p>\n<p><strong>Kip-Up (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, while the swashbuckler has at least 1 panache point, she can kip-up from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Prone\">prone</a>&nbsp;as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Move-Actions\">move action</a>&nbsp;without provoking an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity\">attack of opportunity</a>. She can kip-up as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>&nbsp;instead by spending 1 panache point.</p>\n<p><strong>Menacing Swordplay (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, while she has at least 1 panache point, when a swashbuckler hits an opponent with a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon, she can choose to use&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/intimidate\">Intimidate</a>&nbsp;to demoralize that opponent as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>&nbsp;instead of a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Precise Strike (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, while she has at least 1 panache point, a swashbuckler gains the ability to strike precisely with a light or one-handed piercing melee weapon (though not&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks\">natural weapon</a>&nbsp;attacks), adding her swashbuckler level to the damage dealt. To use this deed, a swashbuckler cannot attack with a weapon in her other hand or use a shield other than a buckler. She can even use this ability with thrown light or one-handed piercing melee weapons, so long as the target is within 30 feet of her. Any creature that is immune to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Sneak-Attack\">sneak attacks</a>&nbsp;is immune to the additional damage granted by precise strike, and any item or ability that protects a creature from critical hits also protects a creature from the additional damage of a precise strike. This additional damage is precision damage, and isn’t multiplied on a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Critical-Hits\">critical hit</a>. As a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Swift-Actions\">swift action</a>, a swashbuckler can spend 1 panache point to double her precise strike’s damage bonus on the next attack. This benefit must be used before the end of her turn, or it is lost. This deed’s cost cannot be reduced by any ability or effect that reduces the amount of panache points a deed costs (such as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/general-feats/signature-deed-grit\">Signature Deed</a>&nbsp;feat).</p>\n<p><strong>Swashbuckler Initiative (Ex)</strong>: At 3rd level, while the swashbuckler has at least 1 panache point, she gains a +2 bonus on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Initiative\">initiative</a>&nbsp;checks. In addition, if she has the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/quick-draw-combat\">Quick Draw</a>&nbsp;feat, her hands are free and unrestrained, and she has any single light or one-handed piercing melee weapon that isn’t hidden, she can draw that weapon as part of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Initiative\">initiative</a>&nbsp;check.</p>\n<p><strong>Swashbuckler’s Grace (Ex)</strong>: At 7th level, while the swashbuckler has at least 1 panache point, she takes no penalty for moving at full speed when she uses&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/acrobatics\">Acrobatics</a>&nbsp;to attempt to move through a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Threatened-Squares\">threatened</a>&nbsp;area or an enemy’s space.</p>\n<p><strong>Superior Feint (Ex)</strong>: At 7th level, a swashbuckler with at least 1 panache point can, as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>, purposefully miss a creature she could make a melee attack against with a wielded light or one-handed piercing weapon. When she does, the creature is denied its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a>&nbsp;bonus to AC until the start of the swashbuckler’s next turn.</p>\n<p><strong>Targeted Strike (Ex)</strong>: At 7th level, as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions\">full-round action</a>&nbsp;the swashbuckler can spend 1 panache point to make an attack with a single light or one-handed piercing melee weapon that cripples part of a foe’s body. The swashbuckler chooses a part of the body to target. If the attack succeeds, in addition to the attack’s normal damage, the target suffers one of the following effects based on the part of the body targeted. If a creature doesn’t have one of the listed body locations, that body part cannot be targeted.
