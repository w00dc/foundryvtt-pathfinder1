These bonus feats must be ones that affect or improve her defenses or melee attacks. The brawler must meet the prerequisites of the selected bonus&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats\">combat feat</a>.</p>\n<p>Upon reaching 5th level and every 3 levels thereafter, a brawler can choose to learn a new bonus&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats\">combat feat</a>&nbsp;in place of a bonus&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats\">combat feat</a>&nbsp;she has already learned. In effect, the brawler loses the bonus&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats\">combat feat</a>&nbsp;in exchange for the new one. The old feat cannot be one that was used as a prerequisite for another feat, prestige class, or other ability. A brawler can only change one feat at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the feat at the time she gains a new bonus&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats\">combat feat</a>&nbsp;for the level.</p>\n<h2>Brawler's Flurry (Ex)</h2>\n<p>Starting at 2nd level, a brawler can make a brawler’s flurry as a full-attack action. When doing so, a brawler has the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/two-weapon-fighting-combat\">Two-Weapon Fighting</a>&nbsp;feat when attacking with any combination of unarmed strikes, weapons from the close&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/fighter\">fighter</a>&nbsp;weapon group, or weapons with the “<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/monk\">monk</a>” special feature. She does not need to use two different weapons to use this ability.</p>\n<p>A brawler applies her full&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-\">Strength</a>&nbsp;modifier to her damage rolls for all attacks made with brawler’s flurry, whether the attacks are made with an off-hand weapon or a weapon wielded in both hands. A brawler can substitute&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Disarm\">disarm</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Sunder\">sunder</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Trip\">trip</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers\">combat maneuvers</a>&nbsp;for unarmed attacks as part of brawler’s flurry. A brawler with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks\">natural weapons</a>&nbsp;can’t use such weapons as part of brawler’s flurry, nor can she make&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Natural-Attacks\">natural weapon</a>&nbsp;attacks in addition to her brawler’s flurry attacks.</p>\n<p>At 8th level, the brawler gains use of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/improved-two-weapon-fighting-combat\">Improved Two-Weapon Fighting</a>&nbsp;feat when using brawler’s flurry. At 15th level, she gains use of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/greater-two-weapon-fighting-combat\">Greater Two-Weapon Fighting</a>&nbsp;feat when using brawler’s flurry.</p>\n<h2>Maneuver Training (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 3rd level, a brawler can select one&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers\">combat maneuver</a>&nbsp;to receive additional training. She gains a +1 bonus on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers\">combat maneuver</a>&nbsp;checks when performing that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers\">combat maneuver</a>&nbsp;and a +1 bonus to her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Defense\">CMD</a>&nbsp;when defending against that maneuver.</p>\n<p>At 7th level and every 4 levels thereafter, the brawler becomes further trained in another&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers\">combat maneuver</a>, gaining the above +1 bonus&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers\">combat maneuver</a>&nbsp;checks and to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Defense\">CMD</a>. In addition, the bonuses granted by all previous&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/monk#TOC-Maneuver-Training-Ex-\">maneuver training</a>&nbsp;increase by 1 each. (For example, if a brawler chooses&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple\">grapple</a>&nbsp;at 3rd level and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Sunder\">sunder</a>&nbsp;at 7th level, her bonuses to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple\">grapple</a>&nbsp;are +2 and bonuses to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Sunder\">sunder</a>&nbsp;are +1. If she then chooses&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Bull-Rush\">bull rush</a>&nbsp;upon reaching 11th level, her bonuses to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Grapple\">grapple</a>&nbsp;are +3, to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Sunder\">sunder</a>&nbsp;are +2, and to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Bull-Rush\">bull rush</a>&nbsp;are +1.)</p>\n<h2>AC Bonus (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 4th level, when a brawler wears light or no&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, she gains a +1&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Dodge-Bonus\">dodge bonus</a>&nbsp;to AC and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuver-Defense\">CMD</a>. This bonus increases by 1 at 9th, 13th, and 18th levels.</p>\n<p>These bonuses to AC apply against&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Touch-Attacks\">touch</a>&nbsp;attacks. She loses these bonuses while immobilized or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Helpless\">helpless</a>, wearing medium or heavy&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Armor-Bonus\">armor</a>, or carrying a medium or heavy load.</p>\n<h2>Knockout (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 4th level, once per day a brawler can unleash a devastating attack that can instantly knock a target&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious\">unconscious</a>. She must announce this intent before making her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack roll</a>. If the brawler hits and the target takes damage from the blow, the target must succeed at a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Fortitude\">Fortitude</a>&nbsp;saving throw (DC = 10 + 1/2 the brawler’s level + the higher of the brawler’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-\">Strength</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dexterity</a>&nbsp;modifier) or fall&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious\">unconscious</a>&nbsp;for 1d6 rounds. Each round on its turn, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Unconscious\">unconscious</a>&nbsp;target may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Full-Round-Actions\">full-round action</a>&nbsp;that does not provoke&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attacks-of-Opportunity\">attacks of opportunity</a>. Creatures immune to critical hits or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Nonlethal-Damage\">nonlethal damage</a>&nbsp;are immune to this ability. At 10th level, the brawler may use this ability twice per day; at 16th level, she may use it three times per day.</p>\n<h2>Brawler's Strike (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 5th level, a brawler’s unarmed strikes are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction\">damage reduction</a>. At 9th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials#TOC-Iron-Cold\">cold iron</a>&nbsp;and silver for the purpose of overcoming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction\">damage reduction</a>. At 12th level, she chooses one&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment\">alignment</a>&nbsp;component: chaotic, evil, good, or lawful; her unarmed strikes also count as this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment\">alignment</a>&nbsp;for the purpose of overcoming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction\">damage reduction</a>. (This&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment\">alignment</a>&nbsp;component cannot be the opposite of the brawler’s actual&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Alignment\">alignment</a>, such as a good brawler choosing evil strikes.) At 17th level, her unarmed attacks are also treated as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/special-materials#TOC-Adamantine\">adamantine</a>&nbsp;weapons for the purpose of overcoming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction\">damage reduction</a>&nbsp;and bypassing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/damaging-objects#TOC-Hardness\">hardness</a>.</p>\n<h2>Close Weapon Mastery (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 5th level, a brawler’s damage with close weapons increases. When wielding a close weapon, she uses the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/strike-unarmed\">unarmed strike</a>&nbsp;damage of a brawler 4 levels lower instead of the base damage for that weapon (for example, a 5th-level Medium brawler wielding a punching&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/dagger\">dagger</a>&nbsp;deals 1d6 points of damage instead of the weapon’s normal 1d4). If the weapon normally deals more damage than this, its damage is unchanged. This ability does not affect any other aspect of the weapon. The brawler can decide to use the weapon’s base damage instead of her adjusted&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/strike-unarmed\">unarmed strike</a>&nbsp;damage—this must be declared before the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Attack-Roll\">attack roll</a>&nbsp;is made.</p>\n<h2>Awesome Blow (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 16th level, the brawler can as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>&nbsp;perform an awesome blow&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers\">combat maneuver</a>&nbsp;against a corporeal creature of her size or smaller. If the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers\">combat maneuver</a>&nbsp;check succeeds, the opponent takes damage as if the brawler hit it with the close weapon she is wielding or an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/weapons/weapon-descriptions/strike-unarmed\">unarmed strike</a>, it is knocked flying 10 feet in a direction of the brawler’s choice, and it falls&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Prone\">prone</a>. The brawler can only push the opponent in a straight line, and the opponent can’t move closer to the brawler than the square it started in. If an obstacle prevents the completion of the opponent’s move, the opponent and the obstacle each take 1d6 points of damage, and the opponent is knocked&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Prone\">prone</a>&nbsp;in the space adjacent to the obstacle. (Unlike the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/monster-feats/awesome-blow\">Awesome Blow</a>&nbsp;monster feat, the brawler can be of any size to use this ability.)</p>\n<h2>Improved Awesome Blow (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 20th level, the brawler can use her awesome blow ability as an attack rather than as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Standard-Actions\">standard action</a>. She may use it on creatures of any size. If the maneuver roll is a natural 20, the brawler can immediately attempt to confirm the critical by rolling another&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Combat-Maneuvers\">combat maneuver</a>&nbsp;check with all the same modifiers as the one just rolled; if the confirmation roll is successful, the attack deals double damage, and the damage from hitting an obstacle (if any) is also doubled.</p>",
