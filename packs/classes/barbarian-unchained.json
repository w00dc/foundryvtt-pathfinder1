      "value": "<p>For some heroes, the rage that lives within them can’t be contained. Whether this fury is a product of heritage or of nature, these adventurers have learned to harness it, turning its power against their foes. The primal warriors known as barbarians transform their rage into a potent weapon on a battlefield. Heedless of their wounds and possessed of unstoppable bloodlust, these savage brutes are the embodiment of war.</p>\n<p><strong>Unchained:</strong> The unchained barbarian is similar in many regards to its counterpart in the Core Rulebook—she still goes into a rage and gains rage powers, but many of the details have been changed. Rage now grants temporary hit points and static bonuses on attack and damage rolls, rather than bonuses to ability scores that force players to recalculate a number of statistics. Additionally, many rage powers now function whenever the barbarian is raging, as opposed to just once per rage. Finally, the overall utility of many of the rage powers has been adjusted to make them more useful and interesting.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment:</strong> Any nonlawful.</p>\n<p><strong>Hit Die:</strong> d12.</p>\n<p><strong>Starting Wealth:</strong> 3d6 x 10 gp (average 105 gp).</p>\n<h2><span id=\"Class_Skills\">Class Skills</span></h2>\n<p>The barbarian’s class skills are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/acrobatics\" rel=\"nofollow\">Acrobatics</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dex</a>),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/climb\" rel=\"nofollow\">Climb</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Str</a>),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/craft\" rel=\"nofollow\">Craft</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Int</a>),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/handle-animal\" rel=\"nofollow\">Handle Animal</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cha</a>),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/intimidate\" rel=\"nofollow\">Intimidate</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Cha</a>),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge\" rel=\"nofollow\">Knowledge</a>&nbsp;(nature) (<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Int</a>),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/perception\" rel=\"nofollow\">Perception</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wis</a>),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/ride\" rel=\"nofollow\">Ride</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dex</a>),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/survival\" rel=\"nofollow\">Survival</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Wisdom-Wis-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Wis</a>), and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/swim\" rel=\"nofollow\">Swim</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Str</a>).</p>\n<p><strong>Skill Ranks Per Level</strong>: 4 +&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Int</a>&nbsp;modifier.</p>\n<div>\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n</div>",

A barbarian can enter rage as a free action. The total number of rounds of rage per day is renewed after resting for 8 hours, although these hours do not need to be consecutive.</p>\n<p>While in rage, a barbarian gains a +4 morale bonus to her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Strength</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Constitution</a>, as well as a +2 morale bonus on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will\" rel=\"nofollow\">Will</a>&nbsp;saves.

The increase to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Constitution</a>&nbsp;grants the barbarian 2 hit points per Hit Dice, but these disappear when the rage ends and are not lost first like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Temporary-Hit-Points\" rel=\"nofollow\">temporary hit points</a>.

Starting at 2nd level, a barbarian gains a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian/rage-powers\">rage power</a>. She gains another&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian/rage-powers\">rage power</a>&nbsp;for every two levels of barbarian attained after 2nd level. A barbarian gains the benefits of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian/rage-powers\">rage powers</a>&nbsp;only while raging, and some of these powers require the barbarian to take an action first. Unless otherwise noted, a barbarian cannot select an individual power more than once.</p>\n<p>Any barbarian who meets the powers’ prerequisites can select and use rage powers. Totem rage powers grant powers related to a theme. A barbarian cannot select from more than one group of totem rage powers; for example, a barbarian who selects a beast totem rage power cannot later choose to gain any of the dragon totem rage powers (any rage power with “dragon totem” in its title).</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A complete list of rage powers can be found here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/barbarian/rage-powers\">Rage Powers</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Uncanny Dodge (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 2nd level, a barbarian gains the ability to react to danger before her senses would normally allow her to do so. She cannot be caught&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Flat-Footed\" rel=\"nofollow\">flat-footed</a>, nor does she lose her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\">Dex</a>&nbsp;bonus to AC if the attacker is invisible. She still loses her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dexterity</a>&nbsp;bonus to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Armor-Class\" rel=\"nofollow\">armor class</a>&nbsp;if immobilized. A barbarian with this ability can still lose her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/glossary#TOC-Dexterity-Dex-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dexterity</a>&nbsp;bonus to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Armor-Class\" rel=\"nofollow\">armor class</a>&nbsp;if an opponent successfully uses the feint action against her.</p>\n<p>If a barbarian already has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Uncanny-Dodge-Ex-\">uncanny dodge</a>&nbsp;from a different class, she automatically gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Improved-Uncanny-Dodge-Ex-\">improved uncanny dodge</a>&nbsp;(see below) instead.</p>\n<h2>Trap Sense (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 3rd level, a barbarian gains a +1 bonus on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Reflex\" rel=\"nofollow\">Reflex</a>&nbsp;saves made to avoid traps and a +1&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#dodge_bonus\" rel=\"nofollow\">dodge bonus</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Armor-Class\" rel=\"nofollow\">armor class</a>&nbsp;against attacks made by traps. These bonuses increase by +1 every three barbarian levels thereafter (6th, 9th, 12th, 15th, and 18th level). Trap sense bonuses gained from multiple classes stack.</p>\n<h2>Improved Uncanny Dodge (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 5th level and higher, a barbarian can no longer be flanked. This defense denies a rogue the ability to sneak attack the barbarian by flanking her, unless the attacker has at least four more rogue levels than the target has barbarian levels.</p>\n<p>If a character already has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Uncanny-Dodge-Ex-\">uncanny dodge</a>&nbsp;(see above) from another class, the levels from the classes that grant&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/classes/core-classes/rogue#TOC-Uncanny-Dodge-Ex-\">uncanny dodge</a>&nbsp;stack to determine the minimum rogue level required to flank the character.</p>\n<h2>Damage Reduction (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 7th level, a barbarian gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction\" rel=\"nofollow\">damage reduction</a>. Subtract 1 from the damage the barbarian takes each time she is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. At 10th level, and every three barbarian levels thereafter (13th, 16th, and 19th level), this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction\" rel=\"nofollow\">damage reduction</a>&nbsp;rises by 1 point.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Damage-Reduction\" rel=\"nofollow\">Damage reduction</a>&nbsp;can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0.</p>\n<h2>Greater Rage (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 11th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Strength</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Constitution</a>&nbsp;increases to +6 and the morale bonus on her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will\" rel=\"nofollow\">Will</a>&nbsp;saves increases to +3.</p>\n<h2>Indomitable Will (Ex)</h2>\n<p>While in rage, a barbarian of 14th level or higher gains a +4 bonus on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will\" rel=\"nofollow\">Will</a>&nbsp;saves to resist enchantment spells. This bonus stacks with all other modifiers, including the morale bonus on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will\" rel=\"nofollow\">Will</a>&nbsp;saves she also receives during her rage.</p>\n<h2>Tireless Rage (Ex)</h2>\n<p>Starting at 17th level, a barbarian no longer becomes&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/conditions#TOC-Fatigued\" rel=\"nofollow\">fatigued</a>&nbsp;at the end of her rage.</p>\n<h2>Mighty Rage (Ex)</h2>\n<p>At 20th level, when a barbarian enters rage, the morale bonus to her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Strength-Str-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Strength</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-\" rel=\"nofollow\">Constitution</a>&nbsp;increases to +8 and the morale bonus on her&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/combat#TOC-Will\" rel=\"nofollow\">Will</a>&nbsp;saves increases to +4.</p>\n<h1>Ex-Barbarians</h1>\n<p>A barbarian who becomes lawful loses the ability to rage and cannot gain more levels as a barbarian.
