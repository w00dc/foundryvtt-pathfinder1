They gain +2&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Constitution-Con-\">Constitution</a>&nbsp;and +2&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Charisma-Cha-\">Charisma.</a></li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;\">Type</span>: Shabti are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Outsider\">outsiders</a>&nbsp;with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/creature-types#TOC-Native\">native</a>&nbsp;subtype.</li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;\">Size</span>: Shabti are Medium creatures and receive no bonuses or penalties due to their size.</li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;\">Speed</span>: Shabti have a base speed of 30 feet.</li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;\">Languages</span>: Shabti begin play speaking Common. Those with high&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;scores can choose any languages they want (except secret languages, such as Druidic).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Senses</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Darkvision:</strong> Shabti can see perfectly in the dark up to 60 feet.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Defensive Abilities</h3>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;\">Immortal</span>: Shabti do not age naturally and cannot die of old age. While some might come into being at age categories other than adulthood, they never leave their original age category. Spells and effects that cause aging affect a shabti as normal.</li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;\">Immune to Undeath</span>: Shabti can’t become undead. Spells and abilities that would transform a shabti into an undead creature have no effect.</li>\n<li style=\"box-sizing: border-box;\"><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;\">Resist Level Drain</span>: A shabti takes no penalties from energy drain effects, though he can still be killed if he accrues more negative levels than he has Hit Dice. After 24 hours, any negative levels a shabti takes are automatically removed without the need for an additional saving throw.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Skill Racial Abilities</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Past Life&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge\">Knowledge</a></strong>: Shabti remember bits of their past lives. As a result, they treat all&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/knowledge\">Knowledge</a>&nbsp;skills as class skills.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Other Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Shattered Soul:</strong> Shabti who are killed are exceptionally difficult to return to life. Those who attempt to return a shabti to life using raise dead, resurrection, or similar spells must succeed at a caster level check equal to 10 + the shabti’s Hit Dice. If this check fails, the spell fails and the caster can’t return the shabti to life for the next 24 hours (though the caster can try again after this period).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Spell-Like Abilities</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Spell-Like Ability: </strong>Shabti can use&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/s/suggestion\">suggestion</a>&nbsp;once per day as a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Spell-Like-Abilities-Sp-\">spell-like ability</a>, with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Caster-Level\">caster level</a>&nbsp;equal to the shabti’s class level.</li>\n</ul>",
