The reptoid always takes this specific form when it uses this ability.

This ability otherwise functions as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic/all-spells/a/alter-self\">alter self</a>, except the reptoid does not adjust its ability scores. A reptoid can select a new humanoid form by spending 1 week preparing itself for the change, but can then no longer assume its previous humanoid form.</li>\n<li><strong>Mental Potency (Ex)</strong>&nbsp;A reptoid’s mental effects can affect more powerful creatures or a greater number of creatures than normal.
