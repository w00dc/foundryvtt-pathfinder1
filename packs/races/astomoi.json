They have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/bestiary/rules-for-monsters/universal-monster-rules#TOC-Telepathy-Su-\">telepathy</a>&nbsp;with a range of 100 feet. Astomoi with high&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/basics-ability-scores/ability-scores#TOC-Intelligence-Int-\">Intelligence</a>&nbsp;scores can choose any of the following languages: Abyssal, Aklo, Celestial, Elven, Gnome, Infernal, and Sylvan. See the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/skills/linguistics\">Linguistics skill page</a>&nbsp;for more information about these languages.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Senses</h4>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Scent:</strong> Astomoi have the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Scent\">scent</a>&nbsp;special ability.</li>\n<li><strong>Telepathic Senses:</strong> Astomoi can’t speak or see, but can mentally sense the area within 60 feet, as per&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/gamemastering/special-abilities#TOC-Darkvision\">darkvision</a>, and can speak telepathically. An astomoi can’t see anything beyond 60 feet. An astomoi must provide thought&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components\">components</a>&nbsp;for spells that normally require verbal&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic#TOC-Components\">components</a>.

Instead, they absorb the essence of food and drink; this consumes the nutrients of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/equipment/goods-and-services/hunting-camping-survival-gear#TOC-Meal\">meal</a>&nbsp;as though it had been eaten, rendering the food useless to others. Astomoi consume&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.d20pfsrd.com/magic-items/potions\">potions</a>&nbsp;and other ingested materials in the same fashion. Since they never actually ingest anything, they can’t normally be exposed to ingested poisons.</li>\n</ul>",
