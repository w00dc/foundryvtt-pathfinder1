The creature targeted by this spell is infused with magical power, altering the odds of combat to weaken lucky strikes. Critical threats made by the affected creature automatically fail to confirm. Critical threats that automatically confirm due to class features or feats, such as the fighter's weapon mastery, are unaffected by this spell. In addition, when the initial target of this spell fails its Will save to resist <i>Contest of Skill</i>, it can select one additional creature within range of the spell to suffer the effects of the spell as well (Will negates). If this secondary target negates this spell with a successful save, the duration of <i>Contest of Skill</i> on the primary target is reduced to 1 round.</p>\n</div>\n",
