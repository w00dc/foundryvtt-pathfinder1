This spell fools all the senses, convincing the target that its hoard feels and behaves as it should. Only if the target tries to use an item from this illusory hoard for some other purpose does it receive another saving throw to disbelieve the effects of the spell (a wizard trying to use an illusory wand or a dragon trying to unlock a door with an illusory key). For the purposes of this spell, a hoard is any amount of treasure that is too big to be carried by the treasure's owner without magical tools such as <i>bags of holding</i> or <i>portable holes</i>, such as a dragon's hoard, a king's treasury, a merchant's strongbox, or a thief's hidden cache.  The material component is any item worth 10 gp or more taken from the original hoard. This item is consumed by the spell.</p>\n</div>\n",
