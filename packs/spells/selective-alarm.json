You can't choose triggering conditions that rely on unobservable information, such as having it triggered when creatures of a certain alignment enter the area, nor could you have the <i>alarm</i> be triggered by \"something worth more than 5,000 gp\" entering the area, or even \"a weapon\" entering the area, because an item's value and classification as a weapon is subjective, and might vary from one person to the next.</p>\n</div>\n",
