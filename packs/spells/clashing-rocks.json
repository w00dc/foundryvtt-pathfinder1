A creature struck by the <i>clashing rocks</i> takes 20d6 points of bludgeoning damage and is knocked prone.

A successful Reflex save reduces this damage to half and the target remains standing. Creatures other than the target that occupy the spaces where the <i>clashing rocks</i> appear or within their path (30 feet wide, 30 feet high, and up to 60 feet long) must also make Reflex saves or take 10d6 points of bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone (save for half and remain standing). A creature can only take damage once from the <i>clashing rocks</i>, no matter how many times the <i>clashing rocks</i> pass over a target creature.</p>\n</div>\n",
