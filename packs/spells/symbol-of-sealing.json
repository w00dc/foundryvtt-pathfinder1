You can also attune any number of creatures to the <i>symbol of sealing</i>, but doing this extends the casting time as described under <i>symbol of death</i> (Core <i>Rulebook</i> 355). However, the force wall created by the symbol blocks attacks and line of effect even for creatures that know the password or are attuned-the password only prevents them from triggering the symbol, not from ignoring its effects if triggered.</p><p>A <i>disintegrate</i> spell or similar effect can destroy the <i>Wall of Force</i> created by the symbol if the caster makes a caster level check against a DC of 11 + your caster level. A <i>knock</i> spell has no effect on a <i>symbol of sealing</i> or its force wall. A <i>symbol of sealing</i> cannot be dispelled, but mage's disjunction automatically destroys it.</p>\n</div>\n",
