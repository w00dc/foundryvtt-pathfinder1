Over the next 10 minutes, the birds reply as if you had asked them the question using <i>speak with animals</i>, giving you a general consensus answer to the question based on their knowledge. For example, you could ask if there is drinkable water in the area, the location of predators or other creatures, directions to a mountaintop or other natural feature, and so on, and the local bird communities would answer to the best of their ability.  If there are no birds in range, the spell has no effect and you do not get a response. Any creature using <i>speak with animals</i> (or a similar ability) who hears this bird call can understand your question, though it may not be able to reply in a way you can hear.</p>\n</div>\n",
