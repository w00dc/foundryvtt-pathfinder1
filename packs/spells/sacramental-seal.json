While trapped in the object, the creature can't take any actions and is immune to spells and spell-like abilities. The creature remains permanently trapped in the object as long the object remains in your possession. Only a <i>freedom</i>, <i>miracle</i>, or <i>wish</i> spell can dispel the enchantment, though destroying the object frees the creature.  If you relinquish your stewardship of the object (such as giving it away or leaving it in a remote location or extradimensional space), the trapped creature begins to gain control over the object. It immediately gains the ability to communicate telepathically with any creature now in possession of the object. It still can't take any actions besides communicating but can use feats and skills related to speaking (such as Bluff and Diplomacy).  After 1 week of the object being out of your presence, the creature can create a number of haunts with a total CR (that is, the CR of the encounter with all of the haunts at once) equaling 1/4 the creature's Hit Dice. These haunts are centered on the object. The creature can also communicate telepathically up to a range of 100 feet at this point.  After 1 month of the object being out of your presence, the CR total of the haunts the trapped creature can create increases to 1/2 its Hit Dice. In addition to telepathy, it can also impart mental images of its choosing into the mind of any creature holding or carrying the object.  After 1 year of being out of your presence, in addition to the above abilities, the creature can attempt to possess any living  creature with an Intelligence score of 3 or higher that touches the object, as per possessionOA. However, the creature can't personally destroy the object, even while possessing another creature.  Because the binding magic irrevocably weakens the longer you're away from the item, returning it to your ownership doesn't reverse any of the effects. You must free the creature and impose another <i>sacramental seal</i> if you want to restrict its abilities again.  If the object is placed in the stewardship of creatures or a location belonging to your faith, it still counts as being out of your presence but it takes ten times longer for the creature to manifest the above abilities (it would take 10 weeks for it to manifest the ability to create haunts, for example).</p>\n</div>\n",
