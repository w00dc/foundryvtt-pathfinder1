This rune does not cause damage, and sheds light as if it were a torch. While the <i>firebrand</i> burns, any creature it marks is immune to damage from any fire spell you cast.

This ray requires a ranged touch attack to hit and deals 6d6 points of fire damage. Once a creature uses its <i>firebrand</i> to fire a ray in this manner, the effects of the spell end for that creature.</p>\n</div>\n",
