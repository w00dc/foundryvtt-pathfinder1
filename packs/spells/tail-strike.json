If you have a draconic bloodline, the tail matches the appearance of that dragon type; otherwise, it matches the appearance of a dragon type whose alignment matches your own. You gain a tail slam attack that deals 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if Small, 1d8 if Large) + your Strength modifier. If you already have a tail attack, you instead extend the reach of your tail attack by 5 feet. If you have a tail sweep attack, this spell increases its radius by 10 feet.  If used as part of a full-attack action, the tail slam is considered a secondary attack, is made at your full base attack bonus - 5, and adds half your Strength modifier to its damage. You can end this spell before its normal duration by uttering a bestial roar as a swift action. When you do, you can attempt an Intimidate check to demoralize all foes within a 30-foot radius that can hear the roar.  Clerics, inquisitors, oracles, and warpriests who worship dragon deities add <i>tail strike</i> to their class spell lists as a 4th-level spell.</p>\n</div>\n",
