The <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i> affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect.</p><p>Once triggered, the <i>symbol</i> becomes active and glows, lasting for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has affected 150 hit points' worth of creatures, whichever comes first. A creature that enters the area while the <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i> is active is subject to its effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered. A creature need save against the <i>symbol</i> only once as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns while the <i>symbol</i> is still active, it must save again.</p><p>Until it is triggered, the <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i> is inactive (though visible and legible at a distance of 60 feet). To be effective, a <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i> must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location. Covering or hiding the rune renders the <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i> ineffective, unless a creature removes the covering, in which case the <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i> works normally.</p><p>As a default, a <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i> is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune. Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i> can't trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune). Once the spell is cast, a <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i>'s triggering conditions cannot be changed.</p><p>In this case, \"reading\" the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning. Throwing a cover over a <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i> to render it inoperative triggers it if the <i>symbol</i> reacts to touch. You can't use a <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i> offensively; for instance, a touch-triggered <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i> remains untriggered if an item bearing the <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i> is used to touch a creature. Likewise, a <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i> cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe.</p><p>You can also set special triggering limitations of your own. These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. Special conditions for triggering a <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i> can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, HD, and hit points don't qualify.</p><p>When scribing a <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i>, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the <i>symbol</i>'s effect. Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune's effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune. If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again.</p><p>You also can attune any number of creatures to the <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i>, but doing this can extend the casting time. Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as 10 creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour. Attuning a large group (as many as 25 creatures) takes 24 hours. Attuning larger groups takes an additional 24 hours per 25 creatures. Any creature attuned to a <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i> cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its radius when it is triggered. You are automatically considered attuned to your own <i>symbol</i>s of <i><i>death</i>,</i> and thus always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them.</p><p><i>Read magic</i> allows you to identify a <i>symbol</i> with a Spellcraft check (DC 10 + the <i>symbol</i>'s spell level). Of course, if the <i>symbol</i> is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the <i>symbol</i>.</p><p>A <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i> can be removed by a successful <i>dispel magic</i> targeted solely on the rune. An <i>erase</i> spell has no effect on a <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i>. Destruction of the surface where a <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i> is inscribed destroys the <i>symbol</i> but also triggers it.</p><p><i>Symbol of <i>death</i></i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell.</p><p>A permanent <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i> that is disabled or has affected its maximum number of hit points becomes inactive for 10 minutes, but then can be triggered again as normal.</p><p><i>Note:</i> Magic traps such as <i><i>symbol</i> of <i>death</i></i> are hard to detect and disable.
