Helpful animals provide simple assistance (such as using the aid another action on skill checks they understand) as long as the spell lasts, but they flee from attacks and do not support you in combat. At one point during the spell's duration, you can issue a nonverbal command to helpful animals within 60 feet to forage for you; the animal or animals immediately head out into the wilderness to do just that. After 1 hour, the animals return to the location where you issued the command to make you an offering of edible food sufficient for one meal for you and a number of others equal to your caster level.</p>\n</div>\n",
