You select what item the target drops as long as you can see both your target and the item you wish to affect. This use of the spell can't cause a target to lose a held item or anything it is wearing, including jewelry.  You can instead cast <i>lightfingers</i> to attempt a single disarm or stealAPG combat maneuver, using your caster level instead of your base attack bonus, and using your Charisma, Intelligence, or Wisdom modifier, whichever is highest, instead of your Strength modifier. This disarm or steal attempt does not provoke attacks of opportunity and cannot be affected by feats or other means of altering a combat maneuver's effects. This use of the spell is immediately obvious.</p>\n</div>\n",
