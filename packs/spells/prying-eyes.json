It has a Perception modifier equal to your caster level (maximum +15) and is subject to illusions, darkness, fog, and any other factors that affect your ability to receive visual information about your surroundings. An eye traveling in darkness must find its way by touch.</p><p>When you create the eyes, you specify instructions you want them to follow in a command of no more than 25 words. Any knowledge you possess is known by the eyes as well.</p><p>In order to report their findings, the eyes must return to your hand. Each replays in your mind all it has seen during its existence.</p><p>It takes an eye 1 round to replay 1 hour of recorded images. After relaying its findings, an eye disappears.</p><p>If an eye ever gets more than 1 mile away from you, it instantly ceases to exist. However, your link with the eye is such that you won't know if the eye was destroyed because it wandered out of range or because of some other event.</p><p>The eyes exist for up to 1 hour per caster level or until they return to you. <i>Dispel magic</i> can destroy eyes. Roll separately for each eye caught in an area dispel. Of course, if an eye is sent into darkness, it could hit a wall or similar obstacle and destroy itself.</p>\n</div>\n",
