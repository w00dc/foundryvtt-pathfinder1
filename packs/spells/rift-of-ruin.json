You must create the rift on a horizontal surface of sufficient size. Since the rift extends into the Abyss, it does not displace the original underlying material or allow access to areas below the surface-you can create the rift on the deck of a ship as easily as in a dungeon floor or the ground of a forest. Any Large or smaller creature standing in the area where you conjure the rift must succeed at a Reflex save to avoid falling into the hole. If successful, the creature picks which side of the rift it remains on once the rift opens. Unattended objects and structures that can be fully engulfed by the rift automatically fall into it.  The walls of the rift are covered with razor-sharp blades, while the floor seethes with boiling pools of acid, strange chewing  vermin, writhing shards of ice, and all manner of other chaotic and deadly manifestations of the Abyss. A creature that falls into the rift takes 6d6 points of falling damage. Any creature in the rift (starting on the round it enters) takes an additional 6d6 points of damage from the rift's environs, even if the creature is merely climbing or flying within the rift rather than standing at the bottom. This additional damage changes from round to round and is randomly selected from acid, bludgeoning, cold, electricity, fire, piercing, slashing, or sonic. Each round, a creature in the rift can attempt a Reflex save to take half damage that round. The rift's walls have a Climb DC of 25.  When this spell's duration ends, the rift snaps shut, violently expelling all creatures still within. These creatures take double damage from the rift's environs in that round and are knocked prone as they are returned to the surface above.  At any time during the spell's duration, you can use it to conjure a number of Abyssal denizens into the surrounding region as a standard action. Doing so causes the rift to snap shut, ending the spell's duration and returning any creatures that had fallen into it to the ground as detailed above. As the rift snaps shut, choose one of the following creatures or groups of creatures to appear in the area; these Abyssal denizens are treated as if you had summoned them via <i>summon monster VII</i> and remain for a number of rounds equal to the remaining duration of the <i>Rift of Ruin</i> spell. You can choose to summon one of the following: one bebilith, one vrock, 1d3 shadow demons, 1d3 succubi, 1d4+1 babaus, or 1d4+1 brimoraksB6.</p>\n</div>\n",
