If a psychically traumatic or turbulent event happened during that time period, you must succeed at a concentration check (DC = 20, 30, or 40, depending on the severity of the psychic disturbance) or lose concentration on the spell.  At caster level 13th and higher, you can choose to collect impressions from over the course of a longer interval of time than an hour, beginning at 1 week per minute of concentration (as listed on the table below). The amount of detail you receive diminishes, so this eventually makes it harder to distinguish impressions left by anything but the most major events.     <table border ='1'><tr><th>Caster Level</th><th>Time Period</th></tr><tr><td>13th-15th</td><td>1 week per minute</td></tr><tr><td>16th-18th</td><td>1 year per minute</td></tr><tr><td>19th+</td><td>1 century per minute</td></tr></table></p>\n</div>\n",
