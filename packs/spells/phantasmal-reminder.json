This spell can affect only a creature that has taken damage since the end of your last turn. The target first can attempt a Will save to recognize the attack as unreal. If it fails that saving throw, the target must succeed at a Fortitude save or take an amount of damage equal to 1d6 x your caster level (maximum 10d6). Because the damage is a quasi-real memory of existing wounds, this damage can't be reduced or prevented (such as by the <i>shield other</i> spell).  If the target of a <i>phantasmal reminder</i> attack succeeds at the Will save to disbelieve the memory loop and either has natural telepathy or is wearing a <i>helm of telepathy</i>, the memory of damage automatically rebounds to affect you. You must immediately attempt a Will save to disbelieve; if you fail, you take half the spell's damage yourself.</p>\n</div>\n",
