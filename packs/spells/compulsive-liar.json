The spell doesn't affect the target's ability to say things that are neither true nor false, such as questions, commands, or verbal spell components. If the target of this spell is simultaneously compelled to tell the truth (for instance, by being within a <i>zone of</i> truth), the target is only able to say things that are neither true nor false.</p>\n</div>\n",
