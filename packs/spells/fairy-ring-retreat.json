The servants function as <i>unseen servant</i> spells except that they are visible and can go anywhere in the meadow.</p><p>Since the place can be entered only through its special portal, outside conditions do not affect the meadow, nor do conditions inside it pass to the plane beyond.</p>\n</div>\n",
