The mark can be placed on any exposed portion of the creature, typically the head or forearm. The flesh around the handprint becomes rough and scaly, like the hide of a lizard. It also glows with a green radiance (shedding light as a torch) when brought within 60 feet of you. While the handprint glows, the target takes a -2 penalty to AC against your attacks and on saving throws to resist any spell you cast or spell-like ability you use.  Additionally, each day the target remains cursed, more and more of its flesh becomes covered in reptilian scales. The target must succeed at a Fortitude save each day or take 1d4 points of Charisma damage, 1 point of which is Charisma drain instead. A creature reduced to 0 Charisma by this effect is immediately transformed into a small, harmless cave lizard, as the <i>baleful polymorph</i> spell.  As with the effects of <i>bestow curse</i>, the curse inflicted by this spell cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed with a <i>break enchantment</i>, <i>limited <i>wish</i></i>, <i>miracle</i>, <i>remove curse</i>, or <i>wish</i> spell.</p>\n</div>\n",
