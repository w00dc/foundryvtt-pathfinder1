The saving throw has a penalty equal to the number of rounds the target has spent in the oubliette (minimum -1 and maximum -5).

When the target returns from the oubliette, it is confused for a number of rounds equal to the number of rounds of imprisonment (minimum 1), unless it was confined in the oubliette for 10 or more rounds, in which case the target is affected as if it were subject to an <i>insanity</i> spell instead.</p>\n</div>\n",
