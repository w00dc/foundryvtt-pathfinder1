Only a potion created using a conjuration (healing) spell can be affected by this spell. An affected potion turns dark red and reveals a necromantic aura if <i>detect magic</i> is cast on it while it remains under this spell's effects.  When you drink a potion affected by this spell, you do not gain the potion's normal effect. Instead, the first necromancy spell you cast within the next minute is cast at a higher caster level. The bonus to caster level is equal to the spell level of the spell used to create the potion that <i>deathwine</i> affects. For example, a 5th-level wizard who drinks <i>deathwine</i> made from a <i>potion of <i>cure serious wounds</i></i> would cast his next necromancy spell as an 8th-level caster, as <i>cure serious wounds</i> i s a 3 rd-level spell.  In addition, any undead creature (or other creature healed by negative energy) that drinks a potion affected by <i>deathwine</i> is healed of 1d8 points of damage. Any potion not imbibed before this spell's duration expires is destroyed at the end of the <i>deathwine</i>'s duration.</p>\n</div>\n",
