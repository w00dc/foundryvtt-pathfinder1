The wall deals this damage when it appears, and to all creatures in the area on your turn each round. In addition, the wall deals 2d6 points of fire damage + 1 point of fire damage per caster level (maximum +20) to any creature passing through it. The wall deals double damage to undead creatures.</p><p>If you evoke the wall so that it appears where creatures are, each creature takes damage as if passing through the wall. If any 5-foot length of wall takes 20 points or more of cold damage in 1 round, that length goes away. (Do not divide cold damage by 2, as normal for objects.) <i>Wall of Fire</i> can be made permanent with a <i>permanency</i> spell. A permanent <i>Wall of Fire</i> that is extinguished by cold damage becomes inactive for 10 minutes, then reforms at normal strength.</p>\n</div>\n",
