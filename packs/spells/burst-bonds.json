The creature does not take damage as above. If you are grappled and your target fails its save, you may make an immediate attempt to break the grapple (but not reverse it) as a free action, with a +1 luck bonus to your CMB per caster level (maximum +5). If the target creature fails its save and you are restrained by an ability that originally allowed a saving throw, <i>burst bonds</i> allows a new saving throw with a +1 luck bonus per two caster levels (maximum +5).</p>\n</div>\n",
