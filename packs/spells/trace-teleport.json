The spell's area radiates from you and moves as you move. You know the exact origin point of any <i>teleport</i>ation effect that originates within the spell's area, and the exact end point of any <i>teleport</i>ation effect that terminates within the spell's area. Further, you can detect the lingering traces of any <i>teleport</i>ation effect that occurred up to 1 hour previously, in the same fashion. You intuitively know, to the nearest minute, when the <i>teleport</i>ation effect occurred.  Whenever you detect the origin point or termination point of any <i>teleport</i>ation effect with this spell, you can study that origin point or termination point for 1 round. If you do, you can attempt a caster level check (DC = 11 + the <i>teleport</i>ation effect's caster level), taking a -5 penalty if the effect occurred more than 1 minute ago. If you succeed, you gain a glimpse of the <i>teleport</i>ation effect's termination point (if you detected an origin point) or origin point (if you detected a termination point). This glimpse lasts long enough for you to get a brief look at the area, but not long enough to scrutinize it in detail. It doesn't come with any geographic knowledge of the location, so it is not sufficient for <i>teleport</i> or similar magic. You can't retry the caster level check, even if you cast trace <i>teleport</i> again.</p>\n</div>\n",
