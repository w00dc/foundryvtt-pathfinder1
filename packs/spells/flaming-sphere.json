It can be extinguished by any means that would put out a normal fire of its size. The surface of the sphere has a spongy, yielding consistency and so does not cause damage except by its flame. It cannot push aside unwilling creatures or batter down large obstacles. A <i>flaming sphere</i> winks out if it exceeds the spell's range.</p>\n</div>\n",
