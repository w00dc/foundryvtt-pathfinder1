If the target fails its save, it is dazed for 1 round and must make another save on its next turn or be dazed again for 1 round. The target must continue making Will saves each round. If a target makes its Will save, the <i>wandering star motes</i> jump to the nearest enemy within 30 feet, who must now make Will saves every round or be dazed. Any time a target makes its Will save, the <i>wandering star motes</i> jump to the next nearest enemy within 30 feet.</p><p>A given creature can only be affected by the <i>wandering star motes</i> once; once a target has successfully saved against the spell, it cannot be affected again. If there are no new targets within 30 feet of a target that has successfully made its save, the spell immediately ends. The spell only affects enemy creatures; your allies are not affected.</p>\n</div>\n",
