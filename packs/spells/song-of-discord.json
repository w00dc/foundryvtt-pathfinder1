A creature that does not attack its nearest neighbor is free to act normally for that round. Creatures forced by a <i>song of discord</i> to attack their fellows employ all methods at their disposal, choosing their deadliest spells and most advantageous combat tactics. They do not, however, harm targets that have fallen unconscious.</p>\n</div>\n",
