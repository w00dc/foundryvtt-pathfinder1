When you prepare <i>what grows within</i> for the first time, or the first time you use it via a spell-completion or spell-trigger item, you can thereafter be targeted by Xhamen-Dor's infected dreams ability (see page 86). As long as you are under the <i>effect</i>s of <i>what grows within</i>, your mind-affecting spells carry this supernatural taint within them and can infect those who succumb to those <i>effect</i>s. Whenever you successfully affect a creature with one of your mind-affecting spells (this requires the target to fail its saving throw against the spell if the spell allows a save, but automatically affects a target if the spell does not allow a saving throw), that target must also succeed at a Fortitude saving throw against <i>what grows within</i> or it immediately becomes afflicted by a lesser version of Xhamen-Dor's seeded infestation. This infestation does not expose the victim to Xhamen-Dor's infectious dreams, but it can ultimately  result in that creature's transformation into one of the seeded. Each time you affect a creature with <i>what grows within</i> in this manner, the remaining duration of <i>what grows within</i> is reduced by 1 round. If you affect multiple creatures in a round, you choose the order in which they must save against the <i>effect</i>s of <i>what grows within</i>, and reduce the spell's remaining duration by 1 round each time one of them is affected by the infestation.  Lesser Seeded Infestation-save Fortitude DC = spell's save DC; <i>onset</i> immediate; <i>frequency</i> 1/day; <i>effect</i> 1d4 Constitution drain; <i>cure</i> none. This infestation can be <i>cure</i>d by magic alone. A creature whose Constitution is reduced to 0 by this infestation dies and rises from death in 1d4 rounds as a seeded creature (see page 90). This is an infestation <i>effect</i>.</p>\n</div>\n",
