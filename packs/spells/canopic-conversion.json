The bearer gains the benefits of <i>Protection from Evil</i> and <i>sanctuary</i>, but only against that mummy. Unsealing or breaking a jar is a standard action, which dissipates its power (and protection) but lets the bearer issue a short command to the mummy, similar to a <i>suggestion</i> spell (Will DC 23 negates). You (and only you) may unseal all 4 jars in a 10-minute ritual to control the mummy with an similar to <i>geas</i> (Will DC 23 negates); most casters typically include a restriction that the mummy will not harm them, as unsealing the jars leaves them vulnerable.</p><p>The pharaohs of ancient Osirion sometimes used this spell to punish their enemies.
