The targets either forget who exactly performed the named creature's deeds or assume some other individual performed them. Alternatively, you can name either one event lasting no more than 10 minutes per caster level or a single topic (defined at the GM's discretion) such as a shameful secret of the king that was recently revealed or a small revolt that was quelled messily, and erase all recollection of that subject from the minds of all creatures within the area. Memory of facts and topics that are common knowledge (information with a Knowledge check DC of 10 or less) cannot be stolen via this spell.  The lost memories are stored in the focus gem (which grows dull inside and cannot be used as a focus or material component for any other spell, including another casting of this spell). The targets emanate no magic and the spell cannot be dispelled from them; only the focus retains a magic aura, and only by targeting the gem can the spell be dispelled, disjoined, or suppressed with antimagic. If the gem is destroyed or the spell is dispelled (which destroys the gem), all stolen memories return to the affected creatures.</p>\n</div>\n",
