If it fails, it is constrained without harm by the materials enclosing it-the spell cannot be used to crush a creature by increasing its size.</p><p>All equipment worn or carried by a creature is similarly <i>enlarged</i> by the spell.

Any <i>enlarged</i> item that leaves an <i>enlarged</i> creature's possession (including a projectile or thrown weapon) instantly returns to its normal size. This means that thrown and projectile weapons deal their normal damage.
