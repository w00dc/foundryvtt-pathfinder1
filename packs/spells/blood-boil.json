A successful save does not end the spell effect, but does prevent that round's effect. On the round that this spell is cast, the target becomes fatigued. On the next round, as the blood temperature begins to rise, the target's capillaries burst, dealing 1d6 points of Constitution damage to the target. On the third and final round, the target's blood begins to boil; the spell deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (to a maximum of 15d6), and-if the target is still alive-the target becomes exhausted rather than fatigued.</p>\n</div>\n",
