The object is animated, but retains a wickerlike appearance.  A wicker horse has the statistics of a light horse or a pony, except it gains construct traits and counts as both an animal and a construct for the purposes of spells and effects. It gains a number of extra hit points equal to your caster level. It has no skills or feats except as noted below.  A horse made of reeds gains a number of Swim ranks equal to your caster level. A horse made of grasses gains the Run feat and a number of Acrobatics ranks equal to your caster level. A horse made of creepers gains a number of ranks in Climb and Stealth equal to your caster level. A horse made of tree branches is continually affected by <i>barkskin</i>, as cast by a magic-user with a caster level equal to yours.  The wicker horse does not follow any commands given with the Handle Animal skill, and only you can ride it. You can cast this spell only in an environment where suitable plant material is available. When the spell ends or the horse loses all its hit points, the horse falls apart.</p>\n</div>\n",
