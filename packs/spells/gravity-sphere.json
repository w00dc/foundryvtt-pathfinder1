For instance, if a creature falls through 20 feet of a low<i><i>gravity</i> sphere</i> and an additional 30 feet outside the sphere, it would take 1d6 points of damage for the 20 feet of low <i>gravity</i> plus 3d6 points of damage as normal for the 30 feet outside the sphere (for a total of 4d6 points of damage).</p><p>This spell doesn't counteract or negate the effects of other spells that affect <i>gravity</i>; both effects occur simultaneously. For instance, a no-<i>gravity</i> <i><i>gravity</i> sphere</i> spell cast within the area of a <i>reverse <i>gravity</i></i> spell would simply mean that creatures float about until the <i><i>gravity</i> sphere</i>'s duration expires or they exit the <i><i>gravity</i> sphere</i>, at which point they return to the top of the <i>reverse <i>gravity</i></i> effect's area. If both <i>gravity</i>-altering magical effects could not feasibly take place simultaneously (at the GM's discretion), the <i><i>gravity</i> sphere</i> spell supersedes the previous effect (if it's higherlevel than the previous effect) or simply fails (if it's lower-level).</p>\n</div>\n",
