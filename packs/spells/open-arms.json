It can also be cast if a creature uses a spell that causes you to qualify as the creature's favored enemy when you normally wouldn't, such as <i>instant enemy</i> (Advanced Player's Guide 229).  You imbue your weapon with a powerful ability to ward off attacks made against you by the creature that challenged you. You gain a +5 insight bonus to your AC and CMD against the attacks of the initiating creature as long as you hold the weapon. If you release the weapon for any reason, the spell ends.
