If the targeted undead is under the control of another creature and this spell causes the target's effective Hit Dice to exceed the controller's maximum capability, the target creature is immediately freed from control. Any creature capable of controlling undead may attempt to control the target, provided the target's effective HD won't cause the would-be controller to exceed its HD limit. The target's former controller can attempt to regain control over the target by relinquishing command over other creatures until its HD limit is no longer exceeded (or the former controller can wait until the spell's duration expires to attempt this at the target's normal HD).</p>\n</div>\n",
