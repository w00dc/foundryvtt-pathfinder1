To store an image, as part of casting you must touch a gem worth not less than 500 gp.

For 1 minute per caster level, the image stored within the gem becomes visible. Details can be made out as clearly as they could be perceived at the time of casting. Darkvision is of no use for making out details in a stolen image, though low-light vision or other exceptional visual talents may reveal information the caster did not see.</p><p>Light sources brighter than bright light are reduced to bright light in the stolen image. Once the image has been released, it cannot again be recovered from the gem.</p><p><i>Stolen light</i> can be made permanent with the <i>permanency</i> spell by a caster of 10th level for a cost of 5,000 gp.
