Those that fail the save take a penalty on such Survival checks equal to double your caster level, treat all squares they enter as difficult terrain for as long as they are in the area and for 1 hour per caster level thereafter, lose the benefit of all effects that allow them to ignore difficult terrain, and take a -4 penalty to Dexterity.  <i>Lost passage</i> can be made permanent with <i>permanency</i> at a cost of 10,000 gp.</p>\n</div>\n",
