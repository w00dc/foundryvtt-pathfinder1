The target is granted a save to negate such effects even if one is not normally allowed. If it's cast on a living creature that then dies, the target's body and spirit are protected by the spell for its duration. If it's cast on a corpse within 1 round of death, the target's body and soul are both protected. Otherwise, only the body receives the protection.  Any spellcaster that worships Abadar may learn and cast <i>soul vault</i> as a 4th level spell, if it isn't normally on her class spell list. <i>Soul vault</i> can be made permanent with the <i>permanency</i> spell at a cost of 7,500 gp and a minimum caster level of 11th.</p>\n</div>\n",
