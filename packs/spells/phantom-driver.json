The rider has an AC of 20 (+1 size, +4 natural armor, +5 Dex) if it is a Small creature or an AC of 19 (+4 natural armor, +5 Dexterity) if it is a Medium creature. It has 7 hit points + 1 hit point per caster level. If it loses all its hit points, the phantom driver disappears. A phantom driver has a land speed of 30 feet, and makes all driver skill checks (no matter what skills are needed to drive the vehicle) as your caster level + your Intelligence modifier.</p>\n</div>\n",
