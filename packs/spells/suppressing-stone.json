While the spell is active, you gain a +1 resistance bonus on saving throws against mind-affecting effects for every 4 caster levels (maximum +5 at caster level 20). Whenever you fail a saving throw against a mind-affecting spell or effect, you can burn out the focus, transforming it irrevocably into a dull gray <i>ioun stone</i> and ending this spell, but suppressing the mind-affecting effect for 1 round per 2,500 gp of value of the focus (minimum 1 round). Rounds during which the effect is suppressed still count against its duration, and the effect can still be dispelled or disrupted during this time.</p>\n</div>\n",
