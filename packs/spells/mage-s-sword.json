It does not get a bonus for flanking or help a combatant get one. If the sword goes beyond the spell range from you, goes out of your sight, or you are not directing it, it returns to you and hovers.</p><p>Each round after the first, you can use a standard action to switch the sword to a new target. If you do not, the sword continues to attack the previous round's target.</p><p>The sword cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but dispel magic, disintegrate, a sphere of annihilation, or a <i>rod of cancellation</i> affects it. The sword's AC is 13 (10, +0 size bonus for Medium object, +3 deflection bonus).</p><p>If an attacked creature has spell resistance, the resistance is checked the first time mage's sword strikes it. If the sword is successfully resisted, the spell is dispelled. If not, the sword has its normal full effect on that creature for the duration of the spell.</p>\n</div>\n",
