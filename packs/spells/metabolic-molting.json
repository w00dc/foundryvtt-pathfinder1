For 7 days, the subject enters a state of suspended animation (as per <i>temporal</i> stasis), during which it heals from even the most grievous wounds. Each day, the subject regains 5 hit points per Hit Die it has as well as recovering from 2 points of ability damage or ability drain from any ability score of its choice. After 7 days, the shell crumbles away and the subject emerges, its body's severed limbs, broken bones, and ruined organs regrown (as per regenerate).  If the gemstone you use for the component is worth at least 5,000 gp, <i>metabolic molting</i> can bring a target back to life, as long as it has been dead for no more than 1 hour when the spell is cast. When the spell is used on such a creature, the creature comes back to life after 7 days and stabilizes at 0 hit points. A creature brought back to life through <i>metabolic molting</i> gains 1 permanent negative level, or 2 points of Constitution drain if it is 1st level. Like <i>raise dead</i>, this spell can't save creatures slain by death effects.</p>\n</div>\n",
