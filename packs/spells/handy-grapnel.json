With a successful attack roll against an AC equal to 5 plus the hardness of the target object, the <i>handy grapnel</i> strikes and embeds itself in that object with the strength of an iron grappling hook.  As a move action, you can command the rope to extend from the arrow. If you are within a distance equal to the length of the rope and have a hand free, the end of the rope swings directly into your hand. With another move action, you can command the <i>handy grapnel</i> to retract itself up to the grappling hook, pulling up any creature or object supported by the rope at a speed of 50 feet per round.  Once embedded, the rope can be used for climbing or any other purpose a rope could serve, and it can bear up to 200 pounds per level of the caster at a time (maximum 1,000 pounds). If this weight limit is exceeded, the <i>handy grapnel</i> comes loose and any creature or object supported by the rope falls.</p>\n</div>\n",
