The wasp swarm takes the spell's casting time to build its nest; if the  swarm is disrupted in any way (such as by being attacked) before you finish casting this spell, the wasps disappear and the spell fizzles.  Once the wasp swarm has built its nest, this spell also wards the area. As per <i>alarm</i>, when intruders that do not speak the password pass within 20 feet, the swarm is alerted and immediately leaves its nest and attacks the nearest intruder. The swarm pursues that intruder as best it can. Once the swarm attacks an intruder, you have no control over its target or direction of travel. When the spell ends, if the wasps have not left their nest, they and their nest disappear.</p>\n</div>\n",
