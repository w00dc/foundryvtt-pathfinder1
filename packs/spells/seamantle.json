This slam attack has a reach of 30 feet. In addition, as a standard action, you can attempt to extinguish fires by touch.</p><p>You automatically extinguish up to a 10-foot cube of normal fire. Against magical fire effects, your touch acts as <i>dispel magic</i>; this also applies to any non-instantaneous fire affect that comes into contact with you (such as <i>flame blade</i>, <i><i>flaming</i> sphere</i>, or <i>incendiary cloud</i>). Even if you fail to extinguish a fire, you are not harmed by it. A <i>flaming</i> or <i>flaming</i> burst weapon that strikes you has its power suppressed for 1d4 rounds if the wielder fails a Fortitude save.</p>\n</div>\n",
