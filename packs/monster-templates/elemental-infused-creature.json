      "value": "<p><strong>Acquired/Inherited Template</strong>&nbsp;Both<br><strong>Simple Template</strong>&nbsp;No<br><strong>Usable with Summons</strong>&nbsp;No<br><br>Sometimes unpredictable elemental events cause planar energies to infuse mundane creatures with otherworldly power, transforming them into element-infused creatures.<br><br>“Element-infused” is an inherited or acquired template that can be added to any living, corporeal creature. An element-infused creature retains the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here. An element-infused creature has a strong connection to one or two of the elemental planes. Unlike most templates, the element-infused template grants few universal abilities; rather, it grants the creature a choice of several different defensive, offensive, and movement-based abilities that match its particular element or elements. In this way, not all water-infused creatures are necessarily identical. In order to select an ability, at least one of an elementinfused creature’s elements must match one of those listed in parentheses after the ability’s name. For abilities that reference an energy type, the energy type chosen must be associated with one of the creature’s elements: acid (earth), cold (water), electricity (air), or fire (fire).<br><br>An element-infused creature can select a number of movement abilities (see the Speed section), defensive abilities, and offensive abilities (see the Special Attacks section) based on its Hit Dice, as shown in the chart below. In addition, an element-infused creature with 4 or more Hit Dice gains one or more bonus abilities that it can use to select additional abilities from any of these three categories. A creature infused with only one element gains one additional bonus ability.</p>\n<hr>\n<table class=\"inner\" style=\"border-color: white; color: #ffffff; font-family: 'Century Gothic', CenturyGothic, AppleGothic, sans-serif; font-size: 15px; background-color: #0f0f0f;\">\n<tbody style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">\n<tr style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center;\"><strong style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">HD</strong></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\"><strong style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">Movement</strong></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\"><strong style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">Defensive</strong></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\"><strong style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">Offensive</strong></td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\"><strong style=\"margin-top: 0px;\">Bonus</strong></td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background: #3e3e3e;\">\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center;\">1-3</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">1</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">1</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">1</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center;\">4-6</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">1</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">1</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">1</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background: #3e3e3e;\">\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center;\">7-9</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">1</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">2</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">1</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center;\">10-12</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">1</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">2</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">1</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background: #3e3e3e;\">\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center;\">13-15</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">1</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">2</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">2</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center;\">16-18</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">1</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">2</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">2</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr style=\"background: #3e3e3e;\">\n<td style=\"margin: 0px; border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; text-align: center;\">19+</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">1</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">3</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">2</td>\n<td style=\"border: 1px solid white; padding: 1px 5px; margin: 0px; text-align: center;\">3</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>CR: </strong>If 9 HD or fewer, base creature’s CR + 1; if 10 HD or more, base creature’s + 2.<br><br><strong>Type:</strong> The creature’s type chances to outsider (native). In addition, the creature gains the air, earth, fire, or water subtypes corresponding to its element or elements. Do not recalculate HD, BAB, or saves.<br><br><strong>Senses:</strong> An element-infused creature gains darkvision with a range of up to 60 feet.<br><br><strong>Defensive Abilities: </strong>An element-infused creature can choose one or more of the following extraordinary abilities.<br><br><em>Damage Reduction (any): </em>The creature gains DR 2/—. If the creature has 10 or more HD, this ability can be selected one additional time, increasing the damage reduction to 5/—.<br><br><em>Energy Immunity (any):</em> The creature gains immunity to one of its associated energy types, chosen when it gains this ability. The creature must already have energy resistance 10 or higher for that energy in order to select this ability.<br><br><em>Energy Resistance (any):</em> The creature ignores the first 10 points of damage that it takes from one of its associated energy types, chosen when it gains this ability. A fire-infused creature that selects this ability also ignores the damage dealt by the fire-dominant planar trait.<br><br><em>Evasion (air or fire):</em> The creature gains the ability to avoid damage as if it had the evasion rogue class ability.<br><br><em>Fiery Blood (fire):</em> Anyone who damages the creature with a slashing or piercing melee weapon is sprayed with boiling blood that deals 1d4 points of fire damage. This damage increases by 1d4 for every 5 HD the creature has. Creatures using reach weapons are not subject to this damage.<br><br><em>Fortification (any): </em>The creature has a 50% chance to negate a critical hit or sneak attack, taking only the normal amount of damage from the attack.<br><br><em>Improved Natural Armor (earth): </em>The creature’s natural armor bonus improves by 2. If the creature has 10 or more HD, this bonus increases to 3.<br><br><em>Indistinct Form (air or water)</em>: The creature benefits from a 20% miss chance as if it had concealment.<br><br><em>Stability (earth or water):</em> The creature receives a +4 racial bonus to its CMD when resisting bull rush, drag, overrun, or trip combat maneuvers.<br><br><strong>Speed:</strong> An element-infused creature can choose one or more of the following abilities. Except where noted, these are extraordinary abilities.<br><br><em>Burrow (earth):</em> The creature gains a burrow speed equal to half its highest speed. Tunnels it creates always collapse behind it and never leave behind a usable passage.<br><br><em>Earth Glide (earth):</em> The creature gains the earth glide ability of an earth elemental (Pathfinder RPG Bestiary&nbsp;122), though it can use this ability for only 1 minute per HD it has. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. The creature must have a burrow speed in order to use this ability. It can select this ability a second time in order to use this power at will.<br><br><em>Flight (air):</em> The creature gains a fly speed equal to its highest speed with average maneuverability (maximum fly speed of 10 feet per HD).<br><br><em>Improved Quickness (Su, fire): </em>Three times per day as a swift action, the creature can take an extra move action. The creature must already have quickness to select this ability.<br><br><em>Puddle Form (Su, water): </em>Once per day, the creature can turn into an animate puddle of water for up to 10 minutes. This functions as gaseous form, but the creature instead has both a base speed and swim speed of 10 feet.<br><br><em>Quickness (fire): </em>The creature’s base movement speed increases by 10, and it gains a +1 bonus on initiative checks. For every 5 HD the creature has, its base speed increases by an additional 10 feet (maximum = double its base speed), and its initiative bonus increases by 1 (maximum +5).<br><br><em>Swim (water): </em>The creature gains a swim speed equal to its highest speed (maximum 100 feet). The creature also gains the amphibious and aquatic subtypes.<br><br><strong>Special Attacks: </strong>An element-infused creature can choose one or more of the following abilities.<br><br><em>Breath Weapon (Su, any):</em> The creature gains a breath weapon (15-foot cone or 30-foot line) that it can use as a standard action once every minute. The breath weapon deals 1d6 points of damage of one of its associated energy types (Reflex half, DC = 10 + 1/2 creature’s HD + Con modifier). The damage increases by 1d6 for every 3 HD the creature has. If the creature has 10 or more HD, the size of the breath weapon doubles.<br><br><em>Burn (Ex, fire): </em>The creature can set creatures it strikes on fire, as per the burn ability (Bestiary&nbsp;298), though only with attacks augmented by its energy attacks ability.<br><br><em>Energy Attacks (Ex, any):</em> One of the creature’s natural attacks deals an additional 1d6 points of its corresponding energy’s damage, selected when the creature gains this ability. This damage increases by 1d6 for every 10 HD the creature has. An element-infused creature can select this ability multiple times, applying its benefits to an additional two natural attacks each time.<br><br><em>Gusting Strike (Ex, air):</em> Once per round when the creature hits with a melee attack, it can attempt a bull rush combat maneuver check against the target of its melee attack as a free action. This bull rush does not provoke an attack of opportunity.<br><br><em>Toppling Strike (Ex, earth or water): </em>The element-infused creature gains the trip special ability (Bestiary: 305) with one of its natural attacks.<br><br><strong>Abilities: </strong>An element-infused creature gains a +4 bonus to two ability scores of its choice, a +2 bonus to two other ability scores of its choice, and a –2 penalty to one ability score of its choice. (Go to the \"Changes\" tab to set these modifiers)<br><br><strong>Skills:</strong> An element-infused creature with racial Hit Dice has a number of skill points per racial Hit Die equal to 6 + Intelligence mod. Racial class skills are unchanged, and class level skill ranks are unaffected.<br><br><strong>Languages:</strong> The creature gains an elemental language or languages associated with its elemental type as long as it has an Intelligence score of 3 or higher: Aquan (water), Auran (air), Ignan (fire), or Terran (earth). If the base creature is unable to speak, it can instead understand the acquired languages.</p>",
