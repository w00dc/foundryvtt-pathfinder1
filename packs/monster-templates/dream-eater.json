      "value": "<p><strong>Acquired/Inherited Template</strong>&nbsp;Acquired<br><strong>Simple Template</strong>&nbsp;No<br><strong>Usable with Summons&nbsp;</strong>Yes<br><br>An endless variety of beings exist within and below the Pyramid of Kamaria. Among the most unique denizens of the pyramid, however, are the dream eaters. Created by the&nbsp;Gem of Dreams&nbsp;(see page 43), these onetime humans have been warped by nightmares into deformed creatures. The Rovagug cultists themselves have built a strange mythology for themselves around this practice—they believe the&nbsp;Gem of Dreams&nbsp;to be a gift sent them by their god. According to their myths, once the Rough Beast emerges from the Dead Vault and destroys Golarion, the corpse world left behind would be populated only by those Rovagug has chosen for survival. It is through this magical gem’s capacity to transform dreamers into monsters that they believe they are being so selected.<br><br>“Dream Eater” is an acquired template that can be added to any living intelligent creature through contact with the artifact known as the&nbsp;Gem of Dreams—but once a creature becomes a dream eater, it cannot gain this template again. CR: Same as base creature +2.<br><br></p>\n<p><strong>CR: </strong>Same as base creature +2.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment: </strong>Chaotic evil—most dream eaters become worshipers of Rovagug, demon lords, or other chaotic evil deities.</p>\n<p><strong>Senses: </strong>The base creature gains darkvision 60 ft.; if the base creature already possesses darkvision, the range of that ability increases by 60 ft.</p>\n<p><strong>Immunity: </strong>The base creature becomes immune to mind-affecting effects.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Attacks: </strong>A dream eater gains two special attacks, as detailed below. Both of these special attacks have save DCs equal to 10 + 1/2 the dream eater’s Hit Dice + the dream eater’s Charisma modifier.</p>\n<p><em>Dream Eating (Su): </em>As a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, a dream eater can consume a creature’s subconscious dreams if the victim fails to resist with a Will save. A sleeping victim takes a –2 penalty on saving throws against this ability, but automatically wakens if the save is successful. On a failed save, the victim takes 1d4 points of Charisma damage, and the dream eater gains a number of psychic points equal to the Charisma drained, to a maximum amount of psychic points equal to the dream eater’s Hit Dice.</p>\n<p><em>Psychic Assault (Su): </em>As a swift action, a dream eater can imbue any melee attack he makes with a psychic assault, infusing the mind of the creature struck with hideous nightmare visions and hallucinations. The magnitude of the effect depends on how many psychic points the dream eater spends in the assault. By expending 1 point, the dream eater can cause the victim to become dazzled for 1d6 rounds. By expending 3 points, he can make a victim become staggered for 1d6 rounds. By expending 5 points, he can make the victim nauseated for 1d6 rounds. By expending 7 points, he can make the victim confused for 1d6 rounds. And by expending 9 points, he can stun the victim for 1d6 rounds. The victim can resist the psychic assault entirely by making a Will saving throw.</p>\n<p><strong>Special Abilities: </strong>A dream eater gains telepathy with other dream eaters to a range of 30 feet.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Scores: </strong>Str +6, Dex +2, Con +4, Int +2, Wis +2, Cha +4.</p>\n<p><strong>Skills: </strong>A dream eater gains a +4 racial bonus on Perception and Stealth checks. He also gains a +8 racial bonus on Knowledge (religion) and Knowledge (planes) checks, and these two skills are now always considered class skills for the creature.</p>",
