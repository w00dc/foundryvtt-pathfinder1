      "value": "<p><strong>Acquired/Inherited Template&nbsp;</strong>Acquired<br><strong>Simple Template</strong>&nbsp;No<br><strong>Usable with Summons&nbsp;</strong>No<br><br>When druids are faced with threats to the natural world, they are steadfast and, at times, relentless in their defense of the land. Even in the face of overwhelming odds—an incursion of demons from the Abyss, a creeping plague of necromantic corruption, an unstoppable blight of magical radiation, or a similar supernatural threat to the natural world—some sects of druids refuse to give up or abandon their duties. In these tragic cases, the desperate druids adopt the blasphemous tactic of accepting the corruption into themselves and becoming powerful undead guardians. They fight on not only against the original source of the corruption, but against all living creatures, for these druids become siabraes, and are filled with bitterness and hatred for all others—particularly other druids, whom they regard as cowards. Siabraes do not form spontaneously; they arise only as the result of the horrific&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/OccultRituals.aspx?ItemName=Welcome%20the%20Blighted%20Soul\">Welcome the Blighted Soul</a>&nbsp;ritual.<br><br>“Siabrae” is an acquired template that can be added to any druid who successfully performs the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/OccultRituals.aspx?ItemName=Welome%20the%20Blighted%20Soul\">welcome the blighted soul</a>&nbsp;ritual (hereafter referred to as the base creature). A siabrae can’t have the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/ArchetypeDisplay.aspx?FixedName=Druid%20Blight%20Druid\">blight druid</a>&nbsp;archetype. A siabrae retains all the base creature’s statistics and special abilities except as noted here.<br><br><strong>CR:</strong> Base creature’s CR + 2.<br><br><strong>Alignment: </strong>Neutral evil.<br><br><strong>Type:</strong> The creature’s type changes to undead with the earth subtype. Do not recalculate BAB, saves, or skill ranks.<br><br><strong>Senses:</strong> A siabrae gains darkvision and tremorsense, both with a range of 60 feet.<br><br><strong>Armor Class:</strong> A siabrae has a +10 natural armor bonus or the creature’s normal bonus, whichever is better.<br><br><strong>Hit Dice: </strong>Change the creature’s racial Hit Dice to d8s. All Hit Dice derived from class levels are unchanged. As an undead, a siabrae uses its Charisma modifier to determine its bonus hit points (rather than using its Constitution modifier).<br><br><strong>Defensive Abilities:</strong> In addition to all the abilities granted by its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/UMR.aspx?ItemName=Undead%20Traits\">undead traits</a>, a siabrae gains channel resistance +4, DR 10/ adamantine and bludgeoning, and immunity to fire. A siabrae also gains the following defensive ability.<br><br><em>Blighted Rebirth (Su):</em> When a siabrae is destroyed, it can attempt a DC 20 Fortitude save in order to avoid this end. The siabrae automatically succeeds at this saving throw if it is in contact with blighted or diseased terrain. On a successful save, the siabrae’s body crumbles to dust as the blighted earth absorbs its essence. Its enduring essence begins forming a new body in a random location within 1d10 miles (this new location must contain a mass of unworked stone large enough for the siabrae’s body to form within). This process takes 1d10 days, after which the siabrae emerges from the stone with a peal of thunder, though without any of its gear.<br><br><strong>Speed: </strong>A siabrae gains a burrow speed equal to its land speed, as well as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/UMR.aspx?ItemName=Earth%20Glide\">earth glide</a>&nbsp;ability.<br><br><strong>Attacks:</strong> A siabrae grows a pair of stony antlers from its skull, granting it a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/UMR.aspx?ItemName=Natural%20Attack\">gore attack that deals damage based on the siabrae’s size</a>, but as if it were one size category larger than its actual size. This gore attack is always a primary attack, even when the siabrae also uses weapons. If the siabrae wishes, it can retain these antlers in any form it assumes via wild shape. Shards of the stony antlers break off in wounds—a siabrae’s antlers constantly replenish themselves as these shards break off. A creature damaged by a siabrae’s gore attack must succeed at a Fortitude save (DC = 10 + 1/2 the siabrae’s HD + the siabrae’s Charisma modifier) or turn to stone permanently.<br><br><strong>Special Attacks and Abilities:</strong> A siabrae retains all the special attacks and abilities of the base creature. If it had the ability to use&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/ClassDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Druid\">wild shape</a>, it retains this ability, but it can assume only the form of creatures that cannot fly. Any form it assumes (via wild shape or polymorph effects) and any creature it summons appears diseased, malnourished, or even in an advanced state of decay, although these are cosmetic effects; they do not impact actual game statistics. In addition, a siabrae gains the following special attacks.<br><br><em>Blight Mastery (Su):</em> Any of a siabrae’s spells or effects that would normally be restricted to affecting animals can also affect undead animals.<br><br><em>Blightbond (Ex):</em> A siabrae has an unholy bond with the blighted earth. It loses any animal companion or access to domains it had from its druidic nature bond ability. In place of nature bond, the siabrae’s close ties to the blighted landscape grant it one of the following cleric domains:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/DomainDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Animal\">Animal</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/DomainDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Death\">Death</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/DomainDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Destruction\">Destruction</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/DomainDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Earth\">Earth</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/DomainDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Madness\">Madness</a>, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/DomainDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Repose\">Repose</a>. The blightbond ability otherwise functions the same as nature bond.<br><br><strong>Ability Scores: </strong>Str +2, Wis +2, Cha +2. Being undead, a siabrae has no Constitution score.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Skills: </strong>A siabrae gains a +8 racial bonus on Perception, Sense Motive, and Stealth checks. A siabrae always treats Intimidate, Knowledge (planes), Knowledge (religion), Sense Motive, and Stealth as class skills. Otherwise, a siabrae’s skills are the same as those of the base creature.&nbsp;Feats: A siabrae gains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aonprd.com/FeatDisplay.aspx?ItemName=Toughness\">Toughness</a>&nbsp;as a bonus feat.</p>",
